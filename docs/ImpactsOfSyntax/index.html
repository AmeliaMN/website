# Land acknowledgement

We stand on the homelands of the Wahpekute and Mdewakanton bands of the Dakota Nation. We honor with gratitude the people who’ve stewarded the land through the generations and their ongoing contributions to this region. We acknowledge the ongoing injustices that we have committed against the Dakota Nation, and we wish to interrupt this legacy, beginning with acts of healing and honest storytelling about this place.

In particular, I am interested in the idea of code as language. I'm a teacher, and have taught thousands of people how to program, mostly in R. So, I'm interested in how best to teach people programming languages, as well as how thinking of code as a language can help everyone (even experts) be more productive.

We know human language shapes our thinking, so why should programming languages be different?

# Syntax

### Syntax is the set of rules that govern what statements can be parsed and which are not understandable. Human language has syntax, although people will usually still get the "gist" if you make an error. Programming languages are not so flexible. 

### Every programming language has its own syntax, which we think might have an effect on learning or understanding. While most programming languages have only one syntax, R has many!

I'm going to be talking a lot about R code, and how it is like human language. Like many languages, R has different dialects, and when learning the language it's best to stick to just one. 

I think of three main R dialects (call them syntaxes or DSLs), so I made this cheatsheet for my students to show them what the other syntaxes look like. 

data.table is not on here, because I don't know how to do data.table visualizations or data.table summary statistics. If you want to implement these same tasks in data.table and send them to me, I'd love to see them!

Of course, practitioners really mix and match the syntaxes shown here, and more, when they are working. But, this has been useful to show students which "column" we are working in, and what the other approaches are. 

I'm interested in how the different syntaxes may impact learning, and whether they lead to different conceptions of data.

### Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool

???
Last year, I published a paper in The American Statistician, based on my dissertation research. In it, I outline an updated set of attributes for a statistical computing tool. I was inspired by the work of John Tukey in the 1960s, and Rolf Biehler, in the 1990s, both of whom thought about how our statistical interfaces could make us more productive, and how they could better support students. 

There are 10 attributes, and not all of them are related to speaking code out loud, but several are.

Accessibility means that a tool needs to be free, or very cheap. It needs to be able to be installed on a variety of operating systems. And, it needs to work for all sorts of people.

Easy entry for novices is about getting started using a tool. This is also called "low threshold." It's important to have something that people can get into.

???
The most relevant to speaking code out loud is "inherent documentation." Essentially, this means that a tool should make it clear what it is doing. In a Graphical User Interface, that might mean an icon or animation that visually shows what a button does. In a programming language, it means language attributes that closely mimic human language.

Finally, a tool needs to have the flexibility to build extensions. CS ed researchers call this a "high ceiling." Novices should not age-out or experience-out. 

I'm probably already losing some of you, because you are not interested in teaching and learning. But, I believe these concepts can also help you work more efficiently. If programmers are spending time trying to speed up their typing speeds, maybe they can spend some time thinking about other ways in which their 

If you need to debug or pair program from afar, you may need to speak about your code over the phone or video conferencing

If you make code that is speakable, that may increase the use of your packages.

# People who can't type

Two main strategies:
- Speak to the computer:
    - Naomi Saphra, ["What Does a Coder Do If They Can't Type?"](http://nsaphra.github.io/post/hands/)
    - Emily Shea, ["Perl Out Loud"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz3JeYfBTcY)
- Speak to another person: 
    - Ian Gilman, ["Wrists &amp; Apprentices"](https://blog.iangilman.com/2018/06/wrists-apprentices.html)

"By the time I was 20 I had developed a chronic wrist injury that I still have decades later. Maybe I should have walked away from computers, but by then I was hooked! That was a dark time, but eventually I struck upon a solution... I could dictate my code to someone else who could be my hands." - Ian Gilman

# People who can't see

Main strategy:
- have the computer speak to you
    - Jonathan Godfrey and Thodor Loots. "Statistical Software (R, SAS, SPSS, and Minitab) for Blind Students and Practitioners" [JSS, Volume 58 Software Review 1](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v058s01). 2013.
    - Jonathan Godfrey, [Statistical software and blind users](https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/StatSoftware/) (tl;dr R is best, but could be better)
    - Jonathan Godfrey, [Interactive graphs for blind and print disabled people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1wS-sK2RLs) useR! 2017 ("SAS is catching up")

.footnote[I guess I'm saying, check out [Dr. Jonathan Godfrey's work](https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=416430)
]

???

Blind folks use screen readers, which read code outloud to them. I know people do this for all programming languages, but I'm most familiar with R. 

RStudio used to not be accessible, now is minimally accessible. But, R itself is good. 

I don't know much about how Deaf folks learn to read.

# English as the language of computing

- C
- Java
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Visual Basic
- JavaScript
- R
- PHP
- Swift

.footnote[Top 10 programming languages for July 2020, [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) ([Commentary by Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1279405379449913344?s=20))
]

???
Of course, even this seemingly-uncontroversial statement is loaded with implicit cultural implications, most specifically about what is "inherently" clear about English. The top ten programming languages in the TIOBE index are all based on English, and there are very few programming languages based in other languages. 

So, "clear for whom" is obviously a question.

And, there is likely intersectionality. If you are blind and your first language isn't English, likely to be doubly hard.

I found Felienne's 2019 keynote at rstudio::conf extremely inspiring. In particular, one of her takeaways was how verbalizing code helps people learn better. She drew on the literature of [linguistics], and has done some studies on having students read code out loud. This was already something I was doing in my teaching, but I immediately became even more dedicated to it.

In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to get Carpentries certified, where I beefed up on data-driven practices for teaching coding, one of which is "don't touch the learners keyboard" and another is "verbalize what you are doing." 

These two practices go hand in hand, particularly when you're debugging code.

And, they tie in with what Felienne was saying. If we are going to start with "sounding out" code, students will have fewer objects to hold in their working memory.

Okay, so maybe I've convinced you that we should be verbalizing code (either out loud, or at least in our heads), and that it would be good to be consistent. But, there are so many inconsistencies in how things are pronounced in R!

Right assignment operator?

This is more efficient, like Luke Tierney was saying in his keynote, but I don't think it's as readable. 

Even with the two-line approach, you need to figure out what `m1` refers to, almost like determining what a pronoun refers to in human language. In essence, you're doing the nesting yourself.

Homonyms can be either homophones or homographs. A more restrictive definition says they need to be **both**-- spelled the same, pronounced the same, different meanings. 

Bass drum, go fishing and catch a bass.
Eat at the buffet, get buffeted about
A tear ran down my face because I got a tear in my dress

Felienne mentioned these in her keynote, too.

# R homophones and homographs

I have a habit of saying "then" to mean both `%&gt;%` and "linebreak." Those both get pronounced the same, but are spelled very differently, and have different meanings.  

The vbar `|` is usually  "or"

```r
penguins %&gt;%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap" | bill_length_mm &gt; 50)
```

but in formula syntax, it takes on another meaning, "given."


```r
gf_point(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm | sex, data = penguins)
```

---
# R homophones and homographs

Periods are homonyms-- they sometimes they indicate a method, 

```r
plot.dendrogram()
plot.factor()
plot.lm()
as.character()
data.frame()
```

and sometimes are just delimiters,


```r
read.csv()
contrib.url()
```

as.character, plot.data.frame, plot.dendrogram, etc. 

Usually read "dot." 

Homophone-- "then." Spelled differently, different meanings

???

For this article, we conducted **four empirical studies on programming language syntax** as part of a larger analysis [...] two surveys [...] on the intuitiveness of syntax,  two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, **we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax** (both Perl and Java) **did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords**, **but that languages which deviate** (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) **did**.

Data8 may be the largest data science class ever. Thousands of students take the course in person at UC Berkeley, thousands more on edX

I'm not going to read you all this code. It takes a long time to get through. In a pedagogical setting, that time is not "wasted"-- it's necessary! But I don't think you need me to do it today. 

Looks like arrange is misspelled, but it's actually "a range."

# Exercise ported to tidyverse R


```r
# Count how many times the names Jim, Tom, and Huck appear in each chapter.

counts &lt;- huck_finn_chapters %&gt;%
  filter(word %in% c("jim", "tom", "huck")) %&gt;%
  group_by(chapter, word) %&gt;%
  summarize(count = n())

# Plot the cumulative counts:
# how many times in Chapter 1, how many times in Chapters 1 and 2, and so on.

cum_counts &lt;- counts %&gt;%
  group_by(word) %&gt;%
  mutate(cumulativesum = cumsum(count))

ggplot(cum_counts) +
  geom_line(aes(x = chapter, y = cumulativesum, color = word)) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Number of Times Each Name Appears")
```

???

Similarly, not going to read all this code to you. But, I think it is much more readable. 

I wouldn't start with this exercise for novices!!

In programming, if you are repeating yourself a lot, that probably means you can be more efficient.

If you're speaking code, it gets especially tedious to repeat yourself!

tl;dr they (we?) didn't find a difference between base, formula, and tidyverse syntaxes in completion time or number of errors (qualitative or interpreter)

When I look at the results, what I see is a lot of misunderstanding about variables and dataframes. 

No teaching!

# Another experiment

- I've taught R **a lot**, including in introductory statistics labs. 
    - all base R
    - all formula
    - all tidyverse
- Spring 2020 and Fall 2020, I decided to teach one lab in formula, one in tidyverse
- Lab assignments are standardized across all labs (JMP, SPSS, Minitab, Excel, and R)
- Pre-labs documents for formula and tidyverse, as well as links to the associated YouTube videos are available on [my website](https://www.amelia.mn/STAT220labs)
- Students opted-in to pre- and post-surveys. The experiment was approved by the University of St. Thomas' Institutional Review Board. (IRB) 1605810-2.

Standardized labs meant I couldn't change what I asked based on syntax

# Bootstrap

boot &lt;- penguins %&gt;%
  specify(response = flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

### formula

```r
library(mosaic)
boot &lt;- do(1000) * mean(~flipper_length_mm,
  data = resample(penguins)
)
```

.pull-left[
**formula**
- easy
    - introducing `lm()`, `aov()`, `chisq.test()`, etc after students were familiar with `tally()`, `mean()`, `gf_point()`, etc. (thanks, `mosaic` and `ggformula`!)
    - inference using distributional approximations, `prop.test()`, `t.test()`
- hard
    - dealing with `NA` values
    - data wrangling. I used `filter(penguins,  body_mass_g&gt;6000)` to avoid introducing the `%&gt;%`
    
]
.pull-right[
**tidyverse**

    - explaining concepts from bootstrap and randomization (thanks, `infer`!)
- hard

    - inconsistency when we got to modeling, `lm()` and `aov()`
    - summary statistics and inference for two categorical variables

]

**overall**
- easy
    - explaining RMarkdown
    - debugging with hands off the keyboard (even after moving online!)
- hard
    - **variables** Students would struggle to understand that `species` was the variable, not `Adelie`, `Chinstrap` and `Gentoo` (levels). 
    - moving files from a local computer to RStudio Cloud
    - filepaths
   - students using the internet to troubleshoot (too much inconsistency online)

???
Overall, the formula syntax felt more consistent. The folks who work on mosaic, ggformula, etc., have made sure the entire introductory statistics curriculum can be accomplished using that syntax. Those students didn't have to see any dollar signs, and almost every single thing they saw used a formula. 

The tidyverse syntax feels more "useful" to me (bigger use in the wider community), but isn't quite ready for primetime when it comes to the entire intro stats curriculum.

Recall from linear regression, you need observations to be independent from one another. These are repeated measures for students, and time series! So we included ID as a random effect, and modeled month as a fixed effect.

      - Does vocalizing code help with understanding or generalizing data science code?
      - Does the effect of vocalization vary based on syntax? 
- Objective 3: Explore mental models of computational objects
  - How do people conceive of computational objects in statistical programming, such as dataframes, variables, plot objects, and summary statistics?
