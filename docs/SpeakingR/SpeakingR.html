Hi, I'm Amelia McNamara. I'm an assistant professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. I tweet at AmeliaMN, which is a double entendre because my last name is McNamara and I live in Minnesota. I just tweeted a link to these slides if you want to follow along.

Even though we're at a virtual conference, I want us to take a moment to consider the physical space we are each in, and the history of that space. The United States is built on land forcibly taken from Native Americans, and where I am physically located is no different. What is now called Minneapolis and St Paul was originally Dakota land, and continues to have a vibrant Native community. 

I chose this beautiful map of sites in the Twin Cities, labeled in the Dakota language, to show you where I'm physically grounded, and the idea of language is one I'm going to take into my talk.

# Big ideas

- code as language
- specifically, R code as language

```r
lm(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)
```
- how this relates to teaching R, as well as writing R
- syntax considerations
- speak code out loud!

In particular, I am interested in the idea of code as language. I'm a teacher, and have taught thousands of people how to program, mostly in R. So, I'm interested in how best to teach people programming languages, as well as how thinking of code as a language can help everyone (even experts) be more productive.

# Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool

]

{{content}}


???
Last year, I published a paper in The American Statistician, based on my dissertation research. In it, I outline an updated set of attributes for a statistical computing tool. I was inspired by the work of John Tukey in the 1960s, and Rolf Biehler, in the 1990s, both of whom thought about how our statistical interfaces could make us more productive, and how they could better support students. 

One of the attributes that I outlined is "inherent documentation." Essentially, this means that a tool should make it clear what it is doing. In a Graphical User Interface, that might mean an icon or animation that visually shows what a button does. In a programming language, it means language attributes that closely mimic human language.

Of course, even this seemingly-uncontroversial statement is loaded with implicit cultural implications, most specifically about what is "inherently" clear about English. The top ten programming languages in the TIOBE index are all based on English, and there are very few programming languages based in other languages. 

So, "clear for whom" is obviously a question.

## <i class="fas  fa-chalkboard-teacher "></i> How to teach programming (and other things)

- Minimal guidance does not work
- There is research about how people learn!
- Not enough debate in CS education
- Phonetics versus whole language debate in teaching/learning reading
- We teach kids how to sound things out
- Silent reading comes later

I found Felienne's 2019 keynote at rstudio::conf extremely inspiring. In particular, one of her takeaways was how verbalizing code helps people learn better. She drew on the literature of [linguistics], and has done some studies on having students read code out loud. This was already something I was doing in my teaching, but I immediately became even more dedicated to it.

In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to get Carpentries certified, where I beefed up on data-driven practices for teaching coding, one of which is "don't touch the learners keyboard" and another is "verbalize what you are doing." 

These two practices go hand in hand, particularly when you're debugging code.

And, they tie in with what Felienne was saying. If we are going to start with "sounding out" code, students will have fewer objects to hold in their working memory.

- "The students of the experimental group scored significantly higher in the Remembering-level questions"
- "There is no significant difference between the two groups in their answers to the Understanding-level questions."

- "Vocalizing the indentation spaces in a for-loop was among the least followed."

???

For this article, we conducted **four empirical studies on programming language syntax** as part of a larger analysis [...] two surveys [...] on the intuitiveness of syntax,  two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, **we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax** (both Perl and Java) **did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords**, **but that languages which deviate** (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) **did**.

Looks like arrange is misspelled, but it's actually "a range."

# Exercise ported to tidyverse R


```r
# Count how many times the names Jim, Tom, and Huck appear in each chapter.

counts &lt;- huck_finn_chapters %&gt;%
  filter(word %in% c("jim", "tom", "huck")) %&gt;%
  group_by(chapter, word) %&gt;%
  summarize(count = n())

# Plot the cumulative counts:
# how many times in Chapter 1, how many times in Chapters 1 and 2, and so on.

cum_counts &lt;- counts %&gt;%
  group_by(word) %&gt;%
  mutate(cumulativesum = cumsum(count))

ggplot(cum_counts) +
  geom_line(aes(x = chapter, y = cumulativesum, color = word)) +

# Summary statistics three ways


### base

```r
mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 4])
mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 6])
mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 8])

tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
```

### formula

```r
library(mosaic)
mean(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
```

```
##        4        6        8 
## 26.66364 19.74286 15.10000
```


### tidyverse

```r
library(dplyr)
mtcars %&gt;%
  group_by(cyl) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean(mpg))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##     cyl `mean(mpg)`
##   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     4        26.7
## 2     6        19.7

tl;dr they (we?) didn't find a difference between base, formula, and tidyverse syntaxes in completion time or number of errors (qualitative or interpreter)

# What's hard about learning R?

- inconsistency
- variables


---
# So what?

When teaching:

- read code out loud
- be consistent
    - one syntax
    - one pronunciation
- have students read code out loud

When developing functions and packages:

- consider pronunciation 
- be consistent 
    - within your own code
    - with the syntax you want to work with
