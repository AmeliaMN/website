Hi, I'm Amelia McNamara. I'm an assistant professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. I tweet at AmeliaMN, which is a double entendre because my last name is McNamara and I live in Minnesota. I just tweeted a link to these slides if you want to follow along.

Even though we're at a virtual conference, I want us to take a moment to consider the physical space we are each in, and the history of that space. The United States is built on land forcibly taken from Native Americans, and where I am physically located is no different. What is now called Minneapolis and St Paul was originally [Dakota] land, and continues to have a vibrant Native community.

I chose this beautiful map of sites in the Twin Cities, labeled in the  [Dakota] language, to show you where I'm physically grounded, and the idea of language is one I'm going to take into my talk.

In particular, I am interested in the idea of code as language. I'm a teacher, and have taught thousands of people how to program, mostly in R. So, I'm interested in how best to teach people programming languages, as well as how thinking of code as a language can help everyone (even experts) be more productive.

Another aspect I'm interested in is how programming languages shape the way we think. We know human language shapes our thinking, so why should programming languages be different?

# Key Attributes of a Modern Statistical Computing Tool

- Accessibility
- Easy entry for novice users
- Data as a first-order persistent object
- Support for a cycle of exploratory and confirmatory analysis
- Flexible plot creation
- Support for randomization throughout
- Interactivity at every level
- Inherent documentation
- Simple support for narrative, publishing, and reproducibility
- Flexibility to build extensions


[The American Statistician, Volume 73, Issue 4. 2019. ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784)
[Free pre-print on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00985)

???
Last year, I published a paper in The American Statistician, based on my dissertation research. In it, I outline an updated set of attributes for a statistical computing tool. I was inspired by the work of John Tukey in the 1960s, and Rolf Biehler, in the 1990s, both of whom thought about how our statistical interfaces could make us more productive, and how they could better support students. 

One of the attributes that I outlined is "inherent documentation." Essentially, this means that a tool should make it clear what it is doing. In a Graphical User Interface, that might mean an icon or animation that visually shows what a button does. In a programming language, it means language attributes that closely mimic human language.

# English as the language of computing

- C
- Java
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Visual Basic
- JavaScript
- PHP
- R

???
Of course, even this seemingly-uncontroversial statement is loaded with implicit cultural implications, most specifically about what is "inherently" clear about English. The top ten programming languages in the TIOBE index are all based on English, and there are very few programming languages based in other languages. 

So, "clear for whom" is obviously a question.

# How to teach programming (and other things)

Felienne’s rstudio::conf 2019 keynote, Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education
&lt;video src="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/opening-keynote-day2"&gt;video&lt;/video&gt;

([video](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/opening-keynote-day2))

???
I found Felienne's 2019 keynote at rstudio::conf extremely inspiring. In particular, one of her takeaways was how verbalizing code helps people learn better. She drew on the literature of [linguistics], and has done some studies on having students read code out loud. This was already something I was doing in my teaching, but I immediately became even more dedicated to it.

???
In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to get Carpentries certified, where I beefed up on data-driven practices for teaching coding, one of which is "don't touch the learners keyboard" and another is "verbalize what you are doing." 

These two practices go hand in hand, particularly when you're debugging code.

# Efficiency 

Coders do things like work to improve their typing speed to improve their programming, why not think about the language issues, as well?

I'm probably already losing some of you, because you are not interested in teaching and learning. But, I believe these concepts can also help you work more efficiently. If programmers are spending time trying to speed up their typing speeds, maybe they can spend some time thinking about other ways in which their

&gt; Due to this disability, I cannot type or write by hand. Many people have asked me about the stack that enables me to be productive in spite of this limitation. I hope this information is helpful both for people with more severe limitations, and for programmers with mild repetitive stress injuries who can benefit from reducing their keyboard use.

# A shared mental model of how to read code

&gt; [...T]he students of the experimental group scored significantly higher in the Remembering-level questions [...] There is no significant difference between the two groups in their answers to the Understanding-level questions. [...] participants in both groups followed some of the instructed vocalizations more frequently such as the variable's assignment (is). Vocalizing the indentation spaces in a for-loop was among the least followed.

Okay, so maybe I've convinced you that we should be verbalizing code (either out loud, or at least in our heads), and that it would be good to be consistent. But, there are so many inconsistencies in how things are pronounced in R!

&gt;It’s a language for data analysis. And if you think that the language is a little incoherent, a little confusing, a bit of a maze, well then all I have to say is welcome to data analysis.

&gt; For this article, we conducted **four empirical studies on programming language syntax** as part of a larger analysis [...] two surveys [...] on the intuitiveness of syntax,  two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, **we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax** (both Perl and Java) **did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords**, **but that languages which deviate** (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) **did**.
