Even though we're at a virtual conference, I want us to take a moment to consider the physical space we are each in, and the history of that space. The United States is built on land forcibly taken from Native Americans, and where I am physically located is no different. What is now called Minneapolis and St Paul was originally Dakota land, and continues to have a vibrant Native community. 

I chose this beautiful map of sites in the Twin Cities, labeled in the Dakota language, to show you where I'm physically grounded, and the idea of language is one I'm going to take into my talk.

In particular, I am interested in the idea of code as language. I'm a teacher, and have taught thousands of people how to program, mostly in R. So, I'm interested in how best to teach people programming languages, as well as how thinking of code as a language can help everyone (even experts) be more productive.

I'm going to be talking a lot about R code, and how it is like human language. Like many languages, R has different dialects, and when learning the language it's best to stick to just one. 

I think of three main R dialects (call them syntaxes or DSLs), so I made this cheatsheet for my students to show them what the other syntaxes look like. 

data.table is not on here, because I don't know how to do data.table visualizations or data.table summary statistics. If you want to implement these same tasks in data.table and send them to me, I'd love to see them!

Of course, practitioners really mix and match the syntaxes shown here, and more, when they are working. But, this has been useful to show students which "column" we are working in, and what the other approaches are. 

I'm interested in how the different syntaxes may impact learning, and whether they lead to different conceptions of data.

???
Last year, I published a paper in The American Statistician, based on my dissertation research. In it, I outline an updated set of attributes for a statistical computing tool. I was inspired by the work of John Tukey in the 1960s, and Rolf Biehler, in the 1990s, both of whom thought about how our statistical interfaces could make us more productive, and how they could better support students. 

There are 10 attributes, and not all of them are related to speaking code out loud, but several are.

Accessibility means that a tool needs to be free, or very cheap. It needs to be able to be installed on a variety of operating systems. And, it needs to work for all sorts of people.

Easy entry for novices is about getting started using a tool. This is also called "low threshold." It's important to have something that people can get into.

???
The most relevant to speaking code out loud is "inherent documentation." Essentially, this means that a tool should make it clear what it is doing. In a Graphical User Interface, that might mean an icon or animation that visually shows what a button does. In a programming language, it means language attributes that closely mimic human language.

Finally, a tool needs to have the flexibility to build extensions. CS ed researchers call this a "high ceiling." Novices should not age-out or experience-out.

Blind folks use screen readers, which read code outloud to them. I know people do this for all programming languages, but I'm most familiar with R. 

RStudio used to not be accessible, now is minimally accessible. But, R itself is good. 

I don't know much about how Deaf folks learn to read.

???
Of course, even this seemingly-uncontroversial statement is loaded with implicit cultural implications, most specifically about what is "inherently" clear about English. The top ten programming languages in the TIOBE index are all based on English, and there are very few programming languages based in other languages. 

So, "clear for whom" is obviously a question.

And, there is likely intersectionality. If you are blind and your first language isn't English, likely to be doubly hard.

I found Felienne's 2019 keynote at rstudio::conf extremely inspiring. In particular, one of her takeaways was how verbalizing code helps people learn better. She drew on the literature of [linguistics], and has done some studies on having students read code out loud. This was already something I was doing in my teaching, but I immediately became even more dedicated to it.

In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to get Carpentries certified, where I beefed up on data-driven practices for teaching coding, one of which is "don't touch the learners keyboard" and another is "verbalize what you are doing." 

These two practices go hand in hand, particularly when you're debugging code.

And, they tie in with what Felienne was saying. If we are going to start with "sounding out" code, students will have fewer objects to hold in their working memory.

Okay, so maybe I've convinced you that we should be verbalizing code (either out loud, or at least in our heads), and that it would be good to be consistent. But, there are so many inconsistencies in how things are pronounced in R!

This is more efficient, like Luke Tierney was saying in his keynote, but I don't think it's as readable.

# Style

We have style guides for written code, but no style guides for verbal code (yet!). Since the best practice for object names is snake case, we need a way to pronounce the underscore.

No good way to pronounce capital letters, so camel case isn't better for verbalization

So, one way to judge a programming language, syntax, or DSL, is by it's "speakability."

???

For this article, we conducted **four empirical studies on programming language syntax** as part of a larger analysis [...] two surveys [...] on the intuitiveness of syntax,  two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, **we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax** (both Perl and Java) **did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords**, **but that languages which deviate** (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) **did**.

Data8 may be the largest data science class ever. Thousands of students take the course in person at UC Berkeley, thousands more on edX

I'm not going to read you all this code. It takes a long time to get through. In a pedagogical setting, that time is not "wasted"-- it's necessary! But I don't think you need me to do it today. 

Looks like arrange is misspelled, but it's actually "a range."

# Exercise ported to tidyverse R


```r
# Count how many times the names Jim, Tom, and Huck appear in each chapter.

counts &lt;- huck_finn_chapters %&gt;%
  filter(word %in% c("jim", "tom", "huck")) %&gt;%
  group_by(chapter, word) %&gt;%
  summarize(count = n())

# Plot the cumulative counts:
# how many times in Chapter 1, how many times in Chapters 1 and 2, and so on.

cum_counts &lt;- counts %&gt;%
  group_by(word) %&gt;%
  mutate(cumulativesum = cumsum(count))

ggplot(cum_counts) +
  geom_line(aes(x = chapter, y = cumulativesum, color = word)) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Number of Times Each Name Appears")
```

???

Similarly, not going to read all this code to you. But, I think it is much more readable. 

I wouldn't start with this exercise for novices!!

In programming, if you are repeating yourself a lot, that probably means you can be more efficient.

If you're speaking code, it gets especially tedious to repeat yourself!

tl;dr they (we?) didn't find a difference between base, formula, and tidyverse syntaxes in completion time or number of errors (qualitative or interpreter)

When I look at the results, what I see is a lot of misunderstanding about variables and dataframes. 

No teaching!

# Another "experiment"

- I've taught R **a lot**, including in introductory statistics labs. 
    - all base R
    - all formula
    - all tidyverse
- Spring 2020 was my first opportunity to teach introductory statistics labs at St Thomas
- Decided to teach one lab in formula, one in tidyverse
- Lab assignments are standardized across all labs (JMP, SPSS, Minitab, Excel, and R)
- Pre-labs for formula and tidyverse are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/STAT220-labs)
- Videos of labs 5-11 are available on my YouTube channel, [formula labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI90QbcUrjizKEn-eFbGM3MkP), [tidyverse labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI91S_rKq5T9KRgjHG-dClFzN)

Standardized labs meant I couldn't change what I asked based on syntax

# Bootstrap

### tidyverse

```r
library(infer)
boot &lt;- penguins %&gt;%
  specify(response = flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %&gt;%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

### formula

```r
library(mosaic)
boot &lt;- do(1000) * mean(~flipper_length_mm,
  data = resample(penguins)
)
```

---

.pull-left[
**formula**
- easy
    - introducing `lm()`, `aov()`, `chisq.test()`, etc after students were familiar with `tally()`, `mean()`, `gf_point()`, etc. (thanks, `mosaic` and `ggformula`!)
    - inference using distributional approximations, `prop.test()`, `t.test()`
- hard
    - dealing with `NA` values
    - installing packages when we suddenly had to move off RStudio Cloud
    - data wrangling. I used `filter(penguins,  body_mass_g&gt;6000)` to avoid introducing the `%&gt;%`
    
]
.pull-right[
**tidyverse**
- easy
    - explaining concepts from bootstrap and randomization (thanks, `infer`!)
    - installing packages when we suddenly had to move off RStudio Cloud
- hard
    - explaining the difference between the `%&gt;%` and `+` operators
    - inconsistency when we got to modeling, `lm()` and `aov()`
    - inference using distributional approximations (infer has `chisq_test()`, but nothing parallel to `prop.test()` or `t.test()`)

]

**overall**
- easy
    - explaining RMarkdown
    - debugging with hands off the keyboard (even after moving online!)
- hard
    - **variables** Students would struggle to understand that `species` was the variable, not `Adelie`, `Chinstrap` and `Gentoo` (levels). 
    - moving files from a local computer to RStudio Cloud
    - filepaths
   - students using the internet to troubleshoot (too much inconsistency online)

???
Overall, the formula syntax felt more consistent. The folks who work on mosaic, ggformula, etc., have made sure the entire introductory statistics curriculum can be accomplished using that syntax. Those students didn't have to see any dollar signs, and almost every single thing they saw used a formula. 

The tidyverse syntax feels more "useful" to me (bigger use in the wider community), but isn't quite ready for primetime when it comes to the entire intro stats curriculum. 

But, I didn't end up deciding that one was "better" and I'm going to teach both again in the fall.

When you are teaching, consider this. When you are developing new packages, new DSLs, new language elements, consider this. How will we pronounce the new pipe?
