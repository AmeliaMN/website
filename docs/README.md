This is the code for my website, hosted at [http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/index.html](http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/index.html)

It uses bootstrap.js and jekyll. If you wanted to reproduce what I was doing, you would need to download all the files listed here, and [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on your system, navigate to the directory with the files using Terminal, and run `jekyll build` to generate the files included in the `_site` directory. I then use the `makefile.sh` file to transfer everything to the science.smith server.
