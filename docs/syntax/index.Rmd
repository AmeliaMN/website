Even though we're at a virtual conference, I want us to take a moment to consider the physical space we are each in, and the history of that space. The United States is built on land forcibly taken from Native Americans, and where I am physically located is no different. What is now called Minneapolis and St Paul was originally Dakota land, and continues to have a vibrant Native community. 

I chose this beautiful map of sites in the Twin Cities, labeled in the Dakota language, to show you where I'm physically grounded, and the idea of language is one I'm going to take into my talk.

## Programming syntax/dialect/domain specific language (DSL)

> In programming, syntax refers to the rules that specify the correct combined sequence of symbols that can be used to form a correctly structured program using a given programming language. Programmers communicate with computers through the correctly structured syntax, semantics and grammar of a programming language.

## Most programming languages only have one correct syntax. R has many!

Lots of debate in the stat ed community

Of course, practitioners really mix and match the syntaxes shown here, and more, when they are working. But, this has been useful to show students which "column" we are working in, and what the other approaches are. 

I'm interested in how the different syntaxes may impact learning, and whether they lead to different conceptions of data.

For this article, we conducted **four empirical studies on programming language syntax** as part of a larger analysis [...] two surveys [...] on the intuitiveness of syntax,  two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, **we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax** (both Perl and Java) **did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords**, **but that languages which deviate** (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) **did**.

tl;dr they (we?) didn't find a difference between base, formula, and tidyverse syntaxes in completion time or number of errors (qualitative or interpreter)

When I look at the results, what I see is a lot of misunderstanding about variables and dataframes. 

No teaching!

# Choosing syntax

There is debate in the statistics education community about which syntax is best to teach, particularly for the "first course." All three syntaxes have their proponents, but the folks most interested in pedagogy tend to argue about whether formula or tidyverse is best. 

- the base first philosophy typically comes from people who were taught base first, often using [the man page for R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html). Jeff Leek has [argued for the use of base graphics](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/) but very few arguments for base are grounded in pedagogy
- tidyverse first philosophy, as espoused by David Robinson ([post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/), and [talk](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2018/teach-the-tidyverse-to-beginners/)) and implicitly by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel in her [Start with cake](https://datasciencebox.org/design-principles.html#start-with-cake) argument
- formula first philosophy, ["the third way"](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/options-for-teaching-r-to-beginners-a-false-dichotomy/), as laid out by Nick Horton. This philosophy led to the `mosaic` package, which Horton coauthored with [Randy Pruim](http://www.mosaic-web.org/ggformula/articles/ggformula-blog.html) and [Danny Kaplan](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/preface-to-this-electronic-version.html).

# Choosing syntax

I've taught R **a lot**, including in introductory statistics labs. 
  - all base R
  - all formula
  - all tidyverse
    
When I teach a particular tool (or even just a particular syntax), I know I unconsciously modify the tasks to be easier to do in that tool. This makes it really hard to compare!

# Another "experiment"
In Spring 2020, I had my first opportunity to teach introductory statistics labs at St Thomas. I couldn't decide which syntax to teach, so I thought  

![](img/both.png)

---
class: big-bullet
# Another "experiment"
I decided to teach one lab completely in formula syntax, the other entirely in tidyverse. 

At the University of St Thomas, lab assignments are standardized across all labs (JMP, SPSS, Minitab, Excel, and R). This forced me to write my "pre-labs" to accomplish exactly the same tasks in both syntaxes. 

Received IRB approval to study this "experiment." (St Thomas IRB #1605810-1). 

Of course, Spring 2020 was a mess of a semester. So, I repeated the "experiment" in Fall 2020 (IRB #1605810-2). I'm still working on the data analysis, but I've realized it was more of a case study than a true experiment. 

---
class: big-bullet
# Experimental protocol

The two labs were randomized to be tidyverse or formula (coin flip at the beginning of the semester). 

I attempted to switch the order in which I wrote the pre-labs and recorded the videos. This did not always happen. 

Students had to consent to participate in the pre- and post-tests.

# Materials

If you want to dig into all the materials, there is a [page on my website](https://www.amelia.mn/STAT220labs) that summarizes the content in each of the labs, and links to the appropriate RMarkdown document as well as the YouTube video to follow along with. 

All the RMarkdown documents for the pre-labs are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/STAT220-labs), and the videos are in two playlists, one for the  [formula labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI90bHK9fapPS-eZCUhgROh6S) and the other for the [tidyverse labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI93eBVuAONFBCVdOd7VFhKQX)

# Materials and guidance

- "all the R you need" cheatsheet for the semester
- weekly pre-lab, in RMarkdown
- pre-lab YouTube video
- real lab assignment, in RMarkdown
- synchronous class time on Zoom

???
Each week, the students were given an RMarkdown document that contained the "pre-lab" for the week. This pre-lab covered the material needed for the real lab (e.g., descriptive statistics and visualizations for one categorical variable). They were also sent a link to the associated YouTube video(s). Distribution was via Canvas. 


Students were expected to work through the pre-lab material asynchronously on their own. Ahead of the synchronous class time, another RMarkdown document with the real lab assignment would become available. 

During our scheduled synchronous time on Zoom, I would answer any questions from the pre-lab, help everyone at least load the data for the real lab, and give them any lab-specific tips. Typically this took less than 20 minutes. I was available for the rest of the synchronous time to answer questions live. Students would work in breakout rooms, or leave the Zoom meeting and come back if they had a question. 

Submitted labs needed to be "knitted" HTML files, not the source RMarkdown. Since we were working on rstudio.cloud, one source of confusion was moving files between the cloud and a student's local computer.

- moving files from a local computer to RStudio Cloud
- filepaths
- students using the internet to troubleshoot (too much inconsistency online)

Overall, the formula syntax felt more consistent. The folks who work on mosaic, ggformula, etc., have made sure the entire introductory statistics curriculum can be accomplished using that syntax. Those students didn't have to see any dollar signs, and almost every single thing they saw used a formula. 

The tidyverse syntax feels more "useful" to me (bigger use in the wider community), but isn't quite ready for primetime when it comes to the entire intro stats curriculum. 

But, I didn't end up deciding that one was "better" and I'm going to teach both again in the fall.

I'm still not sure which syntax I would recommend people to use. 

Overall, the formula syntax felt more consistent. The folks who work on `mosaic` and `ggformula` have made sure the entire introductory statistics curriculum can be accomplished using that syntax. Those students didn't have to see any dollar signs, and almost every single thing they saw used a formula. 

The `tidyverse` syntax feels more "useful" to me (bigger use in the wider community), but it hasn't been given the same level of thought when it comes to the entire intro stats curriculum.
