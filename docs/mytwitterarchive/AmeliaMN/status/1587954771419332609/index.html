  	      The Powerball is really big right now. Like, almost record-breaking big. The jackpot is $1.2 Billion. But, it's very unlikely that you will win. The odds of winning are 1 in 292,201,338.

  	      We can do that same math for the Powerball. $1.2 Billion x (1/292,201,338) is $4.11. So the very simplest calculation says that the expected value for the Powerball is $4! That's twice as much as it costs to buy a ticket.

  	      But of course it's more complicated than that. Almost no one takes the full jackpot amount (split over the course of many years) and instead takes the lump sum. Today's lump sum is $596.7 Million. If we do our expected value math with that… <a href="https://vis.social/@amelia/109276880283629875">https://vis.social/@amelia/109276880283629875</a>

  	      When the expected value of the cash payout becomes positive, I personally buy 1 ticket. It's fun to dream about winning the lottery, and that threshold means I rarely buy a ticket.

  	      But actually the expected value calculation is even MORE complicated. There are other prizes you could win, with different odds. There are taxes to consider. And, even if you get the exact numbers right, there may be other people who also had that… <a href="https://vis.social/@amelia/109276890028551802">https://vis.social/@amelia/109276890028551802</a>

  	      Again, it's fun to dream. If you want to try your luck at the Powerball, there are still a couple of hours to buy a ticket. My recommendation is to buy just one ticket, and pick a random number (either generated yourself, like I do, or generated by the… <a href="https://vis.social/@amelia/109276897576114629">https://vis.social/@amelia/109276897576114629</a>
