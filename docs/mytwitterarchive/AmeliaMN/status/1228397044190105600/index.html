  	      Of course, I knew the research about bias in teaching evaluations. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-We-Must-Stop-Relying-on/243213">https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-We-Must-Stop-Relying-on/243213</a> The bias impacts all minority groups, but most relevant to me is that women tend to get more negative comments and lower numeric scores than men.

  	      But there's more than that. As part of diversity training for @UofStThomasMN, I'm going through some modules about unconscious bias, and they linked out to this (awesome!) explorable by @benmschmidt about biased language in teaching evaluations. <a href="https://benschmidt.org/profGender/">https://benschmidt.org/profGender/</a>

  	      I had seen the explorable before, and again, understood the idea of bias in the abstract. But one of the most common complaints in my written evaluations is that I am "disorganized." This is something that I have worked *so* hard on improving, but still see comments about.

  	      So it really hit home when I put in "disorganized" as a search term in @benmschmidt's explorable. <a href="http://bit.ly/disorganized_evals">http://bit.ly/disorganized_evals</a> There's a big difference between female and male professors there. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1228397053975441408-EQwkm0wX0AEo3Ch.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1228397053975441408-EQwkm0wX0AEo3Ch.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      The difference looks less pronounced in mathematics, larger in "science" and in between for computer science. I don't know which group is the most accurate point of comparison for statistics, but certainly the broad trend is illustrative.

  	      I'm not sure what to do with this information. Of course, I will continue channeling the Sherrerd Center and trying to improve my teaching, as well as my organization. But maybe I need to cut myself a little slack. <br><br>And that's probably enough vulnerability for today!
