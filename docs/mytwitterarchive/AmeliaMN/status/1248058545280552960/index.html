  	      Today, I ran my Magic Mouse completely out of battery. I plugged it in and assumed it was charged, but it would. not. connect. to my computer again. Restarted the computer several times, turned the mouse on and off again, tried charging more. No luck.

  	      Step 1: there's gotta be another mouse in this place somewhere. Dug through all my closets, the basement, some bins my sibling has stored here. Nothing.

  	      Plugged it in to my computer and... bingo! An extremely unwieldy pointing device, which got me to preferences! And once I re-selected the Magic Mouse, using my presentation clicker, it did, magically, work!!
