  	      Hey hey! I was homeschooled my entire childhood, and my parents took an "unschooling" approach, so most of my learning was self-directed. I know a lot of folks are being thrust into the position of being responsible for their kid's education, so just a couple thoughts.

  	      First, give yourself a break. I had many many fewer hours of structured education than most everyone I know, and I turned out fine.

  	      Then, the experience of many unschooling parents is that if you pull your kid from conventional school and go into unschooling, kids will spend several weeks watching TV, playing video games, etc. Eventually, kids come back around to learning. Kids are information sponges!

  	      So, if you're struggling to work from home and manage your child's education, take this as permission from me to just turn on the iPad/"educational" YouTube videos/whatever it is you need to get through the next couple weeks. The kids are gonna be alright.

  	      In case you're curious, I spent most of my unstructured time as a child reading novels (I'd guess I averaged about one novel a day across ages 4-14). I also read non-fiction (one time I decided to attempt reading the entire encyclopedia) but it was mostly fiction.

  	      My parents occasionally pushed me into doing educational work I didn't want to-- a spelling curriculum around age 11 that I credit with me not looking like a total idiot, occasional prods to do math.

  	      But, I skipped a lot of the content from elementary and middle school. I can't really write in cursive. I never memorized my times tables (ðŸ˜± I'm a stats professor now!) or the capitals of US states

  	      I followed my own interests and turned out fine. So if your kid has something they are really into (bugs, rocks, building things in minecraft, writing stories), I'd recommend encouraging that! They can make up other stuff later, or maybe it won't make a difference in the long run
