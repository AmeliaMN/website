  	      One thing I immediately wanted to be able to do is align text to the top of a slide, rather than vertically centered. It took me quite a while to figure this out, but SO to the rescue: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41852462/vertical-alignment-in-beamer-presentation-generated-with-r-markdown">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41852462/vertical-alignment-in-beamer-presentation-generated-with-r-markdown</a> {.t} was what I was looking for!

  	      Next up, I want to be able to make an image full-page. Not generated from R code, just an embedded image. Any tips?
