  	      Thanks to @rafalab for humoring my questions during @StatModeling's webinar about election polling and predictions! I may eventually write a blogpost about this, but for now just a twitter thread about some thoughts.

  	      I am not an expert in polling or election predictions, but I regularly teach a second statistics course for undergraduates on regression modeling. I started teaching as a professor in 2015, which means I've now done two post-presidential-election debriefs with my students.

  	      In 2016, I had been following the models really closely in advance of the election. I thought that Clinton had a good chance of winning, but I'd seen the confidence/credible intervals for the state outcomes and almost all of them included a Clinton loss.

  	      So, I was surprised with the outcome but understood how organizations "got it wrong." (I'm putting that in scare quotes because if the actual result was in the interval, they technically got it right.) I liked Rafa's post on @simplystats about this: <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2016/11/09/not-all-forecasters-got-it-wrong/">https://simplystatistics.org/2016/11/09/not-all-forecasters-got-it-wrong/</a>

  	      But, after that election I thought about election predictions and decided that I, philosophically, didn't care about them.

  	      The result will be what it will be. Why do we want to predict it? To target ads? So we can feel like our candidate will win, and be complacent and stay home (thus, changing the outcome), or fired up that our candidate will lose and turn out (thus, changing the outcome)?

  	      All of this means that I didn't follow the predictions and modeling very closely this election season. But, I once again felt like I needed to do a debrief with my students in class.

  	      Because it's regression, we talked about the problem of lack of independence because the observations are geographic units, and how that can lead to correlated errors. The residual plots would look really bad for the model run on the actual result!

  	      But I was also wondering about testing and training data. We can train models on historic data, but we don't really get to test them until we see the result. So in the webinar today, I asked @StatModeling about this.

  	      If I'm interpreting his response correctly, he said that if we use 2008 and 2012 data to fit a model, we can't get good point estimates on the 2016 outcome, even with having that data for testing.

  	      So my final thought is, if we couldn't get good predictions for 2016 even post-hoc, why would we possibly think we could predict 2020? It seems like an impossible modeling task.
