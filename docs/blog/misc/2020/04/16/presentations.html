			<h2>Guidelines I follow when giving talks</h2>
			<p class="meta">16 Apr 2020</p>

			<div class="post">
			<p>As with everything in life, there are no hard-and-fast rules for giving talks. But, I have a number of conventions I have developed over the years that I think make for clear(er) presentations. If you look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI91PMsa69RJcdKG4L4BiV5MX">talks I have given</a> you will see many of these things in practice. I started writing up some of these conventions for my Data Communication course, but realized there might be broader interest, so I’m making it a blog post.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a class="thumb" href=""><img src="https://www.amelia.mn/img/YouTubeTalks.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Videos of talks I've given on YouTube" /></a></p>

<h2 id="intro-slide">Intro slide</h2>

<p>The intro slide should be eye-catching, because it is often up on the screen for longer than everything else. If you’re giving a talk in person, it is sometimes on the screen for several minutes before you actually get up to give your talk, and for the first moments as you begin speaking.</p>

<p>I always try to find an engaging image on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> that is Creative Commons licensed. Google Image search also has a filter for CC licensed images, but I find the collection on flickr to be better.</p>

<p>My first image always bleeds across the entire slide. Evergreen Data has a <a href="https://stephanieevergreen.com/bleeding-your-presentation/">nice explanation</a> of why it’s good to bleed images wherever possible. To make slides look nice in high resolution, I always download the largest possible image from flickr.</p>

<p>Over the image, I put the title of my presentation, my name, and at least one way to contact me (usually my twitter handle).</p>

<h2 id="introducing-yourself">Introducing yourself</h2>

<p>When you begin a presentation you are often nervous. I’ve developed a little “patter” I say at the beginning of any talk I give in person. It goes something like this: “I’m Amelia McNamara. I teach at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota, and I tweet at AmeliaMN. That’s a double-entendre, because my last name is McNamara, and I live in Minnesota. I just tweeted a link to these slides, if you want to follow along.” By the time I’ve said that (out of sheer force of habit) usually my nerves have calmed down, and I can begin with my content. (In classes, I find I almost always start with “hi folks! It’s [insert day of the week]” for similar reasons.)</p>

<h2 id="slide-content">Slide content</h2>

<p>As Edward Tufte so effectively explains in <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB">PowerPoint does Rocket Science</a>, many technical presentations get bogged down by having too much information on the screen at once. I try my best to not include formulas on slides unless absolutely necessary, and reduce the number of words on slides as well.</p>

<p>You want your audience focusing on what you have to say, more than reading what’s behind you. But, the slides should give them something to look at (maybe a pretty picture!) or an overview of the idea. I mostly present at conferences, and attendees like to take photos of slides and live-tweet them, so a slide that stands alone as a summary is a good way to encourage that.</p>

<p>Much like optimizing the data-ink ratio for a data visualization, you can often simplify a slide down to just its most important point by <a href="http://stephanieevergreen.com/atomic-slide-development/">iteratively removing information</a>. If you have an image on a slide, it should probably fill or almost-fill the slide. Same with a data visualization. When I include a ggplot image on a slide, I scale it so the visualization fills as much of the page as possible, often cutting off some of the white margins at the top and bottom. <a href="https://stephanieevergreen.com/rottemplate/">The rule of thirds</a> can make your slides look more professionally-designed.</p>

<p>Evergreen Data has a <a href="https://stephanieevergreen.com/top-four-mistakes-seen-in-conference-presentations/">summary of the top four mistakes seen in conference presentations</a>. I disagree slightly with some of these mistakes– I tend to include references on each slide, both hyperlinks to my image sources (to credit those CC-licensed image creators!) and links to original papers and other materials. However, I try to use a URL-shortening service whenever possible. Most commonly, I use <a href="bit.ly">bit.ly</a> and customize the shortlinks to be readable. For example, I’ve made <a href="bit.ly/AllHailTheAlgorithm">bit.ly/AllHailTheAlgorithm</a>, which links to a piece of journalism by Al Jazeera called All Hail the Algorithm. It’s a simple-enough link  people watching can type it out as they watch, and again, I always distribute slides via twitter before I give a talk. St Thomas also has <a href="https://link.stthomas.edu/login">a link shortener</a> if you want professional links with a St Thomas theme.</p>

<p>In general, slide animations are <a href="https://stephanieevergreen.com/how-i-feel-about-slide-animations/">usually distracting</a>, so it’s best not to use them. However, if used carefully, animations can be very effective. One convention I’ve become slightly known for is embedding screen-capture videos into my slides, so I can show how a piece of software works or a piece of code executes (<a href="https://youtu.be/hps9r7JZQP8?t=930">example 1</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLcd6tRTUEY?t=314">example 2</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wn5larsRHro?t=718">example 3</a>). Crucially, while I’m showing a video, I never am hitting play on something with sound. Instead, it’s a silent video and I get to talk over it live during my presentation.</p>

<h2 id="building-slide-shows">Building slide shows</h2>

<p>There are a number of platforms for making decks of slides. The most common are probably PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides. Personally, I use Keynote because it works the most seamlessly on a Mac.</p>

<p>If you want to work more reproducibly, there are options like Beamer (the way to make slides using LaTeX, a typesetting language for math) and variations on RMarkdown that knit to PDF or HTML slide shows. Personally, I don’t think those platforms give me as much control as I want, and are a lot of overhead to learn. I only use them if I need to include a lot of typeset math, or (sometimes) code.</p>

<p>Even with code, I often use Keynote because it makes it easier to get things exactly the size I want. I do use the <a href="https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html">reprex venue RTF</a> to get code highlighting to paste into Keynote.</p>

<p>In our new world of online education, I’ve found myself doing a lot of video-recorded presentations. I find full-screen presentations with just a voiceover to be pretty hard to stay attentive to, so I try to have a picture-in-picture of myself talking any time I do one of these recordings. At least on my computer, using the widescreen (16:9) format for my slides rather than standard (4:3) format allows me to get a nice picture-in-picture automatically when recording from Zoom, and easily when recording with a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> as well. I did a short <a href="https://youtu.be/BtSeEeeVzk0">behind-the-scenes video</a> of how I record using Zoom.</p>

<h2 id="giving-the-presentation">Giving the presentation</h2>

<p>When I’m given the opportunity to present from my own computer, I always use the Keynote file and take advantage of all the settings I can pre-select (I have my presenter view customized, I know what will happen to my videos when I click, etc).</p>

<p>If I have to use someone else’s computer, I export my slides to PDF and use the static slides for my presentation. Sometimes I will “print each stage of builds” if I’ve designed some type of buildable slide (text appearing on a slide, for example). This will end up creating more pages for my PDF, but is nicer while I present.</p>

<p>I also always export to PDF to share slides with others, and for that usecase I do <strong>not</strong> “print each stage of builds.” People coming to my twitter or website for a copy of my slides are mostly skimming for links and takeaways, they don’t need the entire build-up of the presentation.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/_inundata/status/748681351864283136">fast-talking R mafia</a>, the thing I am reminding myself the most often while I speak is “slow down” (unless I’m giving a lighting talk where I <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-dr-amelia-mcnamara">whiz through 30 slides in 5 minutes</a>). It’s good to build in some places to pause as you speak, to give your audience a chance to process. When you finish talking about a slide, that can be a good place to pause. Nicky Case uses <a href="https://youtu.be/uc5rfTkLzlY?t=142">water breaks to good effect</a> for this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="ending-your-talk">Ending your talk</h2>

<p>I have a strongly-held opinion that the last words out of your mouth at the end of a talk should always be “thank you.” This makes it clear you are finished speaking, and also gives the audience a non-awkward opportunity to clap. If you say “any questions?” then the audience claps but it’s a little awkward (can you tell I have social anxiety?). Hadley Wickham says <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1220867364557934593?s=20">the key is to end with a firm statement (ie. no rising intonation) and then pause</a>, but coming up with something to say in a firm way that is not “thank you” is usually beyond me at the end of a talk. Just like having a patter to begin a talk, having one to end your talk also helps free your brain up to think about other things.</p>

<p>My last slide always says “thank you” in big letters, to remind me to say this. I also typically repeat the same image background as my original slide, and repeat how to contact me. Jenny Bryan and Mara Averick <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/07/carpe-talk/">disagree with me a little on this point</a>, and say it’s better to have a slide at the end with an overview and links. I think that’s probably great, but I often need the “thank you” cue.</p>

<p>On that note, that’s all I have to say about giving presentations. Thank you.</p>
