  <h1>Interactive Statistical Programming: Theory, Methods, and Applications</h1>
  <p class="lead">My dissertation is focused on the tools we use to do and teach statistics. For a general overview of the problems I am thinking about, see my page on <a href="FOSP.html">the future of statistical programming</a>.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a need for new computational tools to address modern data problems, such as teaching students true data analysis, making transparent data journalism, and providing user rewards to participants in citizen science projects. Novices (people with little to no knowledge of statistics or computer science) should be able to start using a platform which will help scaffold them into more sophisticated analysis and computation. Instead of learning on a toy system and making the big leap to a “real” programming language, data analysis can be made visual, to illustrate the processes that are taking place. Such a platform should encourage computational thinking, exploratory data analysis, flexible data visualization, and reproducible and publishable research. When existing statistical tools are evaluated using this theory, they come up short. Therefore, we found it necessary to build a new system that fits within the framework and can be used to support interactive statistical programming. Through the implementation of this system, LivelyR, we have developed additional data analysis and visualization methods that would not be possible using traditional computational tools, and which surface new understandings. Using LivelyR, we present application scenarios and user studies to illustrate the effectiveness of this new type of interactive statistical programming.</p>
