I"<p>As a budding statistician, I struggle with the issue of terminology. Since Iâ€™m no longer just a member of the public, Iâ€™m expected to have a clearer understanding and use of technically specific words, but Iâ€™m just as biased by the popular uses of them! A few words/phrases Iâ€™m working on:</p>

<!--more-->

<p>â€œThe data isâ€ â€“ I know it is â€œthe data are,â€ but that still sounds so weird.</p>

<p>â€œRandomâ€ â€“ I still say this when someone says something unexpected, if I run into a long-lost friend at the mall, or if things appear to have no cause. Random is really quite a specific word, and almost every time I say it, the phenomenon is not random. That brings me to my next word,</p>

<p>â€œPhenomenaâ€ â€“ this sounds like the singular, not the plural.</p>

<p>â€œChaosâ€ â€“ Similar to random, it has a technically specific meaning that I am almost never using correctly. â€œIt was chaos! Everyone was talking at once!â€ really doesnâ€™t describe a chaotic situation at all.</p>

<p>Two of these four errors have been unfortunately been documented in slides of presentations. Oops. Donâ€™t judge me til I have my PhDâ€¦ Iâ€™m working on them!</p>
