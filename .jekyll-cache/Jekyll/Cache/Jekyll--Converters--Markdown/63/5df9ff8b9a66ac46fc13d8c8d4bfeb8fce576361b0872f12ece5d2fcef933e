I"ƒ<p>Donâ€™t you hate having to take a poster to conferences? The tube is bulky, itâ€™s easy to forget in the airport (or on the plane!), sometimes you get charged extra for your â€œadditional carry-onâ€ and often the poster doesnâ€™t look great once it arrives. Plus, itâ€™s expensive to print a poster, and you usually only get one use out of it.</p>
