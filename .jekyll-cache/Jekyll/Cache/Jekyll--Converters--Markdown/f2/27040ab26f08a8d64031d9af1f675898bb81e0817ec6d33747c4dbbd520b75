I"…<p>This past weekend, I attended the <a href="http://ire.org/">IRE</a> <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/">NICAR</a> conference in Baltimore, MD. 
It took me a while to figure out what those acronyms stand for, but theyâ€™re Investigative Reporters and Editors and National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting. 
Now, I am not a reporter, editor, or computer-assisted journalist, but I found the entire conference fascinating and learned a lot. I thought Iâ€™d write up some of my 
impressions to keep them fresh for myself, and in case anyone might be interested in what a statistician thought of a journalism conference.</p>
