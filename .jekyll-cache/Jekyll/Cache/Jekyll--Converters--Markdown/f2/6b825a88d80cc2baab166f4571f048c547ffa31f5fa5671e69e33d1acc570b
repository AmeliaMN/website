I"$<p>Over the last 10 days, I had the pleasure of attending <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf</a> and the Dagstuhl seminar on <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=18061">Evidence about Programmers for Programming Language Design</a>. At rstudio::conf, I taught a two-day workshop on <a href="https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR">Intro to R &amp; RStudio</a>, and at the Dagstuhl I mostly thought about exposing novices to programming in scientific contexts. So, there was a lot of overlap.</p>
