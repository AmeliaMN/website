I"<p>I was glad to see Karl Broman’s blog post on <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2017/12/18/these-guys/">a troubling conference talk</a>. In the post, Karl describes how the speaker repeatedly used the word “guys” to describe people involved in statistics, and how he and Hadley Wickham reached out to him in an effort to get him to change his ways.</p>

<p>If you were in the room during the talk, I’m sure the experience is still viscerally available to you, but for those who were not, I think Karl’s post falls far short of the necessary description to underscore the problem. As I said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/942962475418505216">recent tweet</a>, it’s hard to convey in words how icky the talk was. But, I’m going to make an attempt.</p>
