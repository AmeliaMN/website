I"Ê<p>As you might know from <a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/blog/visualization/2015/01/14/FitbitColors.html">my blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/484751171374948353">twitter</a>, Iâ€™ve been a Fitbit person since December 2013. Iâ€™m also very interested in participatory sensing and citizen science, and Iâ€™ve been thinking about the ways that data can be used for good, both on the personal and societal level.</p>
