I"<p>I have a sweater that I’ve loved to death (if you’ve encountered me anytime in the last 5 years, you’ve probably seen it) and after many frustrating attempts to replace it with something similar, I took to eBay to try to find an exact replacement. This is something I’ve had success with in the past– put in some information about the item, and make a saved search that emails me every day with newly-listed results. But I’ve learned that eBay sellers only know about the mean, and not about variation.</p>
