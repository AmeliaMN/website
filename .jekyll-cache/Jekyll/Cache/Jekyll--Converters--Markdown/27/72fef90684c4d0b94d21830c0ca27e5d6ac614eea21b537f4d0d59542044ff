I"Z<p>This past weekend, I attended the <a href="http://ire.org/">IRE</a> <a href="http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/">NICAR</a> conference in Baltimore, MD. 
It took me a while to figure out what those acronyms stand for, but theyâ€™re Investigative Reporters and Editors and National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting. 
Now, I am not a reporter, editor, or computer-assisted journalist, but I found the entire conference fascinating and learned a lot. I thought Iâ€™d write up some of my 
impressions to keep them fresh for myself, and in case anyone might be interested in what a statistician thought of a journalism conference.</p>

<p>I had a lot of thoughts, so Iâ€™ll be breaking this into a couple pieces. The first thing Iâ€™ll say is that Iâ€™m taking Matt Waiteâ€™s <a href="http://blog.mattwaite.com/post/78333096044/a-5-step-nicar-recovery-plan">advice</a>, and putting my learning into action immediately following NICAR. Thatâ€™s what this blog is! Iâ€™ve been meaning to learn <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> for months now, and writing about NICAR provided the perfect motivating project to learn the tool. Iâ€™ve already switched my entire website to jekyll, and Iâ€™m learning how to build blogs (what jekyll is really good at ) now.</p>

<p>Some resources that have been helpful to me on this journey include:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>xcodebuild <span class="nt">-license</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This turns out to be one of the things that was hanging up my jekyll install. I kept thinking it was a problem with my ruby version, or with some other dependency, but once I had run that and agreed to the xcode user agreement, doing</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll</code></pre></figure>

<p>worked right out of the box.</p>

<p>Once I had jekyll running, I referred to a bunch of other peoplesâ€™ blog posts and github repositories, notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Anna Debenhamâ€™s blog on <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/">getting started with github pages (plus bonus jekyll)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Josh Branchaudâ€™s blog on <a href="http://joshbranchaud.com/blog/2013/03/02/Running-Your-Jekyll-Blog-from-a-Subdirectory.html">running your jekyll blog from a subdirectory</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The snaptortoise github repository on <a href="https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds">jekyll rss feeds</a> (found via Drew Inglisâ€™ post on <a href="http://blog.drewinglis.com/2013/03/18/adding-rss.html">adding RSS to jekyll</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Daring Fireball <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">guide to markdown syntax</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And of course, the jekyll documentation on things like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">writing posts</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, this is a work in progress. But Iâ€™m feeling good about jumping right on something that Iâ€™ve been wanting to try for ages, especially since it came up so much at the conference. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_presentation_and_content">Separation of presentation and content</a>. It is good.</p>
