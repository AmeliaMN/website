I",<p>I get called Amanda a lot. This tends to drive me crazy, because I think
my real name is much more interesting. But, I realized recently that
given the prior probabilities, itâ€™s actually a very reasonable thing to
call me.</p>

<p>[Note: this blog post has some interactive elements, so it is probably more fun to read on <a href="https://ameliamn.shinyapps.io/Amanda/">my shiny server</a>. And of course, if you want to see what I did, the <a href="https://github.com/AmeliaMN/shiny-server/blob/master/Amanda/Amanda.Rmd">code is on GitHub</a>.]</p>
