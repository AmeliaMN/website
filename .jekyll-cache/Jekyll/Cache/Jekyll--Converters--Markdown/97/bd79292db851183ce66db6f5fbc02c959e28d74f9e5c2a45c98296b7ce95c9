I"’<p>Since a lot of the <a href="http://datascience.la">datascience.la</a> meetups are held at <a href="http://www.crosscamp.us/">Cross Campus</a>, I joined their newletter, and Iâ€™m so glad I didâ€“ it leads me to all sorts of cool things! One such event was a talk by <a href="http://red-green-blue.com/about/">Craig Hickman</a> about the history and success of <a href="http://red-green-blue.com/kid-pix-the-early-years/">Kid Pix</a>. If you werenâ€™t a child in the â€™90s, Kid Pix was a fabulously open-ended paint program designed for kids.</p>

<p>The talk was a great mix of nostalgia and inspiration for me. I loved hearing about the principles that guided Hickman as he worked, like the idea of contextual menus, so kids never had to look in the menu bar. I was also brought back to my childhood, creating artwork, menus for pretend restaurants, birthday cards, notes, and much more, all in Kid Pix.</p>
