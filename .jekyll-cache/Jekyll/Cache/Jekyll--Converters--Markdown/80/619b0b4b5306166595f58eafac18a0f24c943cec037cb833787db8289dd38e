I"#<p>I get called Amanda a lot. This tends to drive me crazy, because I think
my real name is much more interesting. But, I realized recently that
given the prior probabilities, it’s actually a very reasonable thing to
call me.</p>

<p>[Note: this blog post has some interactive elements, so it is probably more fun to read on <a href="https://ameliamn.shinyapps.io/Amanda/">my shiny server</a>. And of course, if you want to see what I did, the <a href="https://github.com/AmeliaMN/shiny-server/blob/master/Amanda/Amanda.Rmd">code is on GitHub</a>.]</p>

<p>To investigate this using data, I am using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">babynames</code> R package,
which has data from the Social Security Administration. It includes all
names that had at least 5 uses for a particular gender in a given year.
Obviously, that leaves some people out, but actually this data includes
most (documented) people in the United States. For more about this, see
my data appendix.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to take my (approximate) age and see how likely it is
that my name is Amanda. I look incredibly young, but given that I have a
PhD and am a statistics professor, there’s a lower bound on how young I
could really be. Lets assume that people talking to me believe I was
born between <strong>1980-1989</strong>, inclusive. So the question is, given that I
was born then, <strong>what are the chances my name is Amanda?</strong></p>

<p>In a blog post at the beginning of last semester,
<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/">Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel</a>
<a href="http://citizen-statistician.org/2016/08/13/a-timely-first-day-of-class-example-for-fall-2016-trump-tweets/">linked</a>
to a 538 article from 2014 that approaches the problem from the other
side– <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/">How to tell someone’s age when all you know is her
name</a>.
Interestingly, although using this method would help confirm people’s
suspicions that I’m a child (the <em>Age|Name</em> method would
estimate I’m <a href="http://rhiever.github.io/name-age-calculator/index.html?Gender=F&amp;Name=Amelia">about 13 years
old</a>),
that’s not how people tend to think about names and ages.</p>

<p><a class="thumb" href=""><img src="https://www.amelia.mn/img/amelias-1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Amelias'" /></a></p>

<p>Instead, people seem to be taking an approximate age and then just
grabbing a name out of the hat. In other words, they are using the
<em>Name|Age</em> method. With that in mind, let’s see how likely
Amanda really is. I’m focusing just on girls names for this analysis,
mostly because Amelia isn’t a common boy’s name (see my data appendix).</p>

<p>In the eighties, numbers for Amanda and Amelia were as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">name</th>
<th align="right">number</th>
<th align="right">proportion</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Amanda</td>
<td align="right">369690</td>
<td align="right">0.0215329</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Amelia</td>
<td align="right">9734</td>
<td align="right">0.0005670</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Armed only with the information that I was born between 1985 and 1989,
there’s a <strong>2% chance my name is Amanda</strong>. That’s actually pretty
incredible! (In contrast, there’s just a 0.05% chance my name is
Amelia.) And, we can figure most people remember at least the first
letter of a name. So, what if we add the fact that my name starts with
an A?</p>

<p>In the eighties, numbers for Amanda and Amelia (out of all A names) were
as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">name</th>
<th align="right">proportion</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Amanda</td>
<td align="right">0.1575295</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Amelia</td>
<td align="right">0.0041478</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, there’s a <strong>15.7% chance my name is Amanda</strong> (and a 0.4% chance my
name is Amelia). The only A name that was more popular than Amanda in
the eighties was Ashley, which made up 19.5% of the female names
starting with A. Of course, Ashley doesn’t have as similar of a sound to
Amelia as Amanda does. I didn’t go this far, but we could also look at
the names starting with Am– I think this would serve to solidify Amanda
as the much more likely choice.</p>

<p>So, for those of you that have felt bad about getting my name wrong in
the past– the data supports you!</p>

<p>I’m not sure if doing this analysis has made me feel better about being
called Amanda– for that, I just tell myself <strong>“they’re probably mixing
me up with <a href="http://www.nytco.com/amanda-cox-named-editor-the-upshot/">Amanda
Cox</a>.”</strong></p>

<h2 id="your-name">Your name</h2>

<p>Does this trend hold up with the name people are always calling you? Are
you a Jacob that always gets called Jason? A Kirstin that gets called
Kristen? (I’m guilty of that one.)</p>

<p>[This is the part of the post that is responsive, so you probably want to head to <a href="https://ameliamn.shinyapps.io/Amanda/">my shiny server</a>.]</p>

<h2 id="data-appendix">Data appendix</h2>

<p>I can get off-track when doing analyses, so here are a couple more
thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="how-full-is-the-data">How full is the data?</h3>

<p>One thing I was worried about was how well the data really represented
the population. Uncommon names are excluded for privacy purposes, and I
thought maybe people were getting more (or less) creative with names
over time. It turns out that may be the case, but only slightly.</p>

<p><a class="thumb" href=""><img src="https://www.amelia.mn/img/missingdata-1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Missing data'" /></a></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Min.</th>
<th align="right">1st Qu.</th>
<th align="right">Median</th>
<th align="right">Mean</th>
<th align="right">3rd Qu.</th>
<th align="right">Max.</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">2.462</td>
<td align="right">3.535</td>
<td align="right">5.592</td>
<td align="right">5.406</td>
<td align="right">6.793</td>
<td align="right">9.374</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>On average, only 5% of people are missing from the data. That feels
pretty good to me. The article mentioned above, 538 estimated that only
1% of the data was missing, which I’m not sure how they estimated.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-baby-boys-are-named-amelia">How many baby boys are named Amelia?</h3>

<p>Answer– not many. In 2004, the year with the most male Amelias, 14 baby
boys were named Amelia. Or, someone checked the wrong box on a birth
certificate.</p>

<td align="left">Amelia</td>

</tbody>

<h3 id="creativity-in-naming">Creativity in naming</h3>

<p>Of course, there’s a lot deeper I could dig on this analysis. Just by
scrolling through the data I noticed there are many other ways to spell
Amanda, which didn’t get taken into account. (Maybe the creative
spellings of Amelia balance it out.)</p>

<h3 id="a-is-for-eighties">A is for eighties</h3>

<p>You can actually see the eighties pretty clearly when you look at plots
of letters names start with. Girls’ names starting with A had been on
the rise since the 1960s, but you see a local maximum in about 1984 and
then a small decline before continuing to rise.</p>
