I"∆!<p>It‚Äôs that time of year again, the time where I find myself meeting with students thinking about graduate school in statistics. Since I often end up sending people the same things, I figured I‚Äôd pull them together into a blog post. You probably already know about <a href="https://thegradcafe.com/">the grad cafe</a>, <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/pearlsofwisdom/">the professor is in</a>, and <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD comics</a>. These other links might not be as common.</p>

<h3 id="a-here-are-some-resources-to-help-you-get-a-taste">A: Here are some resources to help you get a taste:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When I was still in graduate school, I wrote a three-part blog series for <a href="http://datascience.la">datascience.la</a> on graduate school: <a href="http://datascience.la/statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/">Statistics grad school‚Äì what is it really like?</a>, <a href="http://datascience.la/part-2-of-statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/">Part 2 of what statistics grad school is like</a>, and <a href="http://datascience.la/paying-for-statistics-grad-school-aka-the/">Part 3: Paying for statistics graduate school</a>.</li>
  <li>I gave some additional advice in this recent <a href="http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2016/09/01/inspire/">interview</a> in AmstatNews.</li>
  <li><a href="https://statsbylopez.com/about/">Michael Lopez</a> also has a piece called <a href="https://statsbylopez.com/2014/07/23/so-you-want-a-graduate-degree-in-statistics/">So you want a graduate degree in statistics?</a>, with sections on deciding on a program, thriving once you are there, and much more. He goes in to the difference between biostatistics and statistics, a PhD and an MA, and how to evaluate programs.</li>

<h3 id="q-where-should-i-go-for-grad-school">Q: Where should I go for grad school?</h3>

<h3 id="a-wherever-seems-like-a-good-fit">A: Wherever seems like a good fit!</h3>

<p>I really think statistics is such an in-demand field that you can get a job with a degree from virtually any school. These show my personal research interests and biases, but a couple of my favorite programs to recommend to students are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://stat.iastate.edu/">Statistics at Iowa State</a>. This is where <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> and <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">Yihui Xie</a> got their PhDs, and current students include <a href="http://cpsievert.github.io/about/">Carson Sievert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/maggiejohnsonmn">Maggie Johnson</a>, <a href="http://andeekaplan.com/">Andee Kaplan</a>, <a href="http://sctyner.github.io/">Samantha Tyner</a>, and <a href="http://erichare.me/">Eric Hare</a>. Notable faculty include <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/">Hieke Hofmann</a> and <a href="http://ugenschel.github.io/">Ulrike Genschel</a>. [Update, 11/27/17, I believe <em>all</em> of those students now have PhDs!]</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html">Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins</a>. This is where <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter">Hilary Parker</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/acfrazee">Alyssa Frazee</a> and <a href="http://jennakrall.com/">Jenna Krall</a> got their PhDs. Notable faculty include <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Roger Peng</a>, <a href="http://jtleek.com/">Jeff Leek</a>, and <a href="http://www.bcaffo.com/">Brian Caffo</a> (of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science/1">Coursera data science specialization</a> fame).</li>
  <li><a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington Interactive Data Lab</a>. Not exactly a grad program, because it involves people from both computer science and the school of information, but does awesome work. Notable students include <a href="http://arvindsatya.com/">Arvind Satyanarayan</a> [Update 11/27/17, he has his PhD!], and faculty include <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/">Jeff Heer</a> of the computer science department and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jhullman/">Jessica Hullman</a> in the iSchool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun fact I recently learned‚Äì Iowa State was the first US university with a department of statistics, and Johns Hopkins the first (in the world?) to offer biostatistics!</p>

<h3 id="a-you-need-lots-of-things-to-be-a-strong-candidate-including">A: You need lots of things to be a strong candidate, including:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>good (but not necessarily perfect) grades</li>
  <li>a decent GRE score (particularly on the quantitative section of the regular GRE)</li>
  <li>a compelling story in your personal statement (email me if you want to read mine, I don‚Äôt feel like posting it on the web)</li>
  <li>solid letters of recommendation, particularly from faculty members who know you well from a variety of contexts, like class, research, etc.</li>
  <li>I also always recommend reaching out to people from the program you are applying to, whether current grad students, alumni, or professors to get a better sense of a program and whether you would be a good fit. <a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.com/">Female Science Professor</a> has <a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2011/10/writing-to-me-reprise.html">a great post</a> about what to say (and not to say) in an email to a professor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-i-recommend-getting-involved-in-some-online-communities">A: I recommend getting involved in some online communities.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There is a ton of activity in statistics and data science on twitter. Most of the faculty and students I mentioned above have twitter accounts (some linked above, the others easy to find), and if you are into R you can get a taste by looking at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash">#tidyverse</a> hashtags.</li>
  <li>Roger Peng and Jeff Leek (mentioned above) and <a href="http://rafalab.github.io/">Rafa Irizarry</a> have a blog called <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/">Simply Statistics</a> with all sorts of interesting statistics discussions.</li>
  <li>Hilary Parker and Roger Peng (mentioned above) have a podcast called <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2015/09/17/not-so-standard-deviations-the-podcast/">Not so standard devations</a>, available on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570?mt=2">iTunes</a>, and many more podcast distributors.</li>

<p>What did I miss? What are other questions you have?</p>
