I"í<p>I have been a devoted Fitbit user for over a year now, and I think that as a device it is the sort of thing that a statistician would natually enjoy. It produces rich data about my day-to-day life, can be used to identify notable dates in my year, and does a great job of making me more physically active ‚Äúon the margin.‚Äù But, the Fitbit app designers have made very strange color choices.</p>
