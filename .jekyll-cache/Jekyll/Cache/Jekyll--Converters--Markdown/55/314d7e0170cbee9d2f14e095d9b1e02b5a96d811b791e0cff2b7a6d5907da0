I"í<p>At the Dagstuhl seminar, <a href="http://web.cs.unlv.edu/stefika/">Andreas Stefik</a> asked me to speak about â€œScientists Programming.â€ Iâ€™m not sure whether he did this on purpose, but by assigning people their talk titles, he drew us a little outside our comfort zone and got us to think more deeply. â€œScientists Programmingâ€ wasnâ€™t a talk that I had in my pocket, and wasnâ€™t what I would have proposed, but it was fun to pull together. It made me realize that scientists programming is actually one of my primary interests, although Iâ€™ve never written that anywhere before. Felienne wrote up a <a href="http://www.felienne.com/archives/5900">nice summary</a> of my talk, but I wanted to write down some thoughts of my own.</p>
