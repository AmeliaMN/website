I"º<p>The <a href="http://www.amelia.mn/sds236/index.html">data journalism course</a> Iâ€™m teaching this semester is a new offering for me. I may write up more of my reflections later, but for now I wanted to get some thoughts down about the experience of using Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool. At this point, I feel like it was too real-world of an experience for the class, and I inadvertently exposed my students to some gendered bias.</p>
