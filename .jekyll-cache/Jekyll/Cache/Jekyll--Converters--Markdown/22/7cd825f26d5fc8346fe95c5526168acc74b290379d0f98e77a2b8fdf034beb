I"Œ<p>Don‚Äôt you hate having to take a poster to conferences? The tube is bulky, it‚Äôs easy to forget in the airport (or on the plane!), sometimes you get charged extra for your ‚Äúadditional carry-on‚Äù and often the poster doesn‚Äôt look great once it arrives. Plus, it‚Äôs expensive to print a poster, and you usually only get one use out of it.</p>

<p>Enter, the fabric poster!</p>

<p>I learned about this wonderful option via twitter, before the Women in Statistics Conference. I was one of three women to bring fabric posters. Shown here are the other two, demonstrating one of the fantastic things about fabric posters‚Äì they‚Äôre flexible!</p>

<p>Better than that, you can fold them up in your suitcase and they don‚Äôt wrinkle (or if they do, you can iron them!). Plus, they have the same DPI as paper, they‚Äôre cheaper, and you can easily re-use them (either as a poster or as a superhero cape). Still not sold? Check out these photos from IEEE Vis in Paris. The conference organizers needed to take down the posters quickly, and almost anyone with a paper poster ended up with something ripped, wrinkled, and taped to someone else‚Äôs poster.</p>

<p>Okay, so how do you do it? <a href="http://ascb.org/how-to-print-a-fabric-poster/">This post</a> is fantastic, and it‚Äôs where I learned how to print a fabric poster. For whatever reason, that link keeps changing, so I‚Äôll summarize the main points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the website <a href="http://www.spoonflower.com">spoonflower.com</a></li>
  <li>choose the ‚Äúperformance knit‚Äù fabric, which should cost around $25</li>
  <li>upload your poster <strong>as a png</strong> (ignore at your peril!)</li>
  <li>make sure it looks right, and order!</li>
</ul>

<p>Printing and shipping is variable, but Spoonflower has a data-driven page that will tell you <a href="http://help.spoonflower.com/customer/portal/articles/1173283-how-long-will-it-take-to-get-my-order-">how many days production is currently taking</a>. If you need your poster quickly, you can pay for rush shipping, but either way the poster will come folded up in one of those soft plastic envelopes that fits easily into any mailbox. What are you waiting for?</p>
