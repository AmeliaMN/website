I"è<p>During <a href="https://openvisconf.com">OpenVisConf</a>, I hurriedly <a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/blog/conferences/2016/04/25/OpenVisConf.html">posted</a> some links from my talk so people could follow up with resources I had mentioned. I kept meaning to write up a fuller blog post, but of course life comes along (in the interim, Smith has finished finals, Iâ€™ve graded a ton of projects, gone out of the state twice, and attended commencement).</p>

<p>So, when the <a href="https://openvisconf.com/#transcripts">official transcripts</a> from the conference were posted, I knew Iâ€™d struck gold. <a href="https://twitter.com/Asignia">Amanda Lundberg</a> was the transcriptionist, and she did a fantastic job. The transcripts are provided with a creative commons license, so I grabbed the text from my talk, edited it a bit, and stuck in some images.</p>

<p>It was quite interesting to read the transcripts as-is. I know Amanda edited out a lot of â€œumâ€s and â€œuhâ€s as everyone was speaking, but a personâ€™s verbal tics still get through. In my case, I say â€œthatâ€, â€œsoâ€, and â€œreallyâ€ a LOT. Some of those have been removed here for ease of reading.</p>

<p>On a more interesting note, the organizers used TF-IDF to identify unique words and bi-grams from each talk. Mine make it <em>pretty</em> clear Iâ€™m a statistician. Words like â€œdistributionâ€, â€œstatisticâ€, â€œobserved differenceâ€ and â€œbootstrapâ€ all appeared more in my talk than others.</p>
