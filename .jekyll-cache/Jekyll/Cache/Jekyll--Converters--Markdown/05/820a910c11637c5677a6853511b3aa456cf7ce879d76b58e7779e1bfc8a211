I"<p>As with everything in life, there are no hard-and-fast rules for giving talks. But, I have a number of conventions I have developed over the years that I think make for clear(er) presentations. If you look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLik6fAQnSI91PMsa69RJcdKG4L4BiV5MX">talks I have given</a> you will see many of these things in practice. I started writing up some of these conventions for my Data Communication course, but realized there might be broader interest, so Iâ€™m making it a blog post.</p>
