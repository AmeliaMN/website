I"\<p>A few weeks ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/1191464296779255814?s=20">tweeted</a> that the first paper to come out of my dissertation was published. I got my PhD in 2015, and it’s now 2019. That means I’ve been thinking about this work for more than four years (in fact, it’s probably closer to seven!).</p>

<p>If you want to read the paper, it’s <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784">now published</a> in Volume 73, Issue 4 of The American Statistician. I was given 100 free e-prints, which are available until they run out <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/WNRYZCHGUMCEUIEC9C9X/full?target=10.1080/00031305.2018.1482784">here</a>. A pre-print of this paper is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00985">the arXiv</a> if you want a non-paywalled version.</p>
