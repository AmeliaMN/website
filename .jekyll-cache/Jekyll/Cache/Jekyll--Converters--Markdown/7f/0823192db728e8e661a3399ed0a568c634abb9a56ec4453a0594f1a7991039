I"œ<p>For my rstudio::conf working, Intro to R &amp; RStudio, I finally finished my <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/syntax.pdf">cheatsheet on R syntaxes</a>. Iâ€™ve been working on this for at least a year (ðŸ˜± ), so Iâ€™m glad to see it out in the wild.</p>

<p>When I posted the cheatsheet online, I got some critical feedback, which I would like to address in the form of a FAQ.</p>
