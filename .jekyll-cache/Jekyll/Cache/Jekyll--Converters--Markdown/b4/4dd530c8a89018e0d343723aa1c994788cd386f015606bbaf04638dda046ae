I"<p>I’m now involved in the recently-launched <a href="http://datascience.la">datascience.la</a> blog. While you’ll probably be drawn to the site for the <a href="http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/sessions/">useR! conference session videos</a>, <a href="http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/interviews/">interviews with data scientists</a>, and meetup announcements, there’s going to be much more!</p>

<p>I’ve posted <a href="http://datascience.la/data-science-goes-to-college-with-datafest/">Data Science Goes to College with DataFest</a>, yet another summary of the yearly DataFest we hold at UCLA and that’s going national.</p>

<p>Then, I wrote <a href="http://datascience.la/statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/">Statistics Grad School– What is it Really Like?</a> describing some of the experience of getting a PhD in statistics at UCLA.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ll be giving a talk at this month’s DataVis LA meetup, <a href="http://datascience.la/datavis-la-meetup-eyeo-festival-highlights-august-26/">Eyeo Festival Highlights</a> on August 26th. Come by Cornerstone OnDemand to hear me talk about the things that inspired me the most from the <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/">eyeo festival</a>.</p>
