I"<p>It’s that time of year again, the time where I find myself meeting with students thinking about graduate school in statistics. Since I often end up sending people the same things, I figured I’d pull them together into a blog post. You probably already know about <a href="https://thegradcafe.com/">the grad cafe</a>, <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/pearlsofwisdom/">the professor is in</a>, and <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD comics</a>. These other links might not be as common.</p>
