I"¬<p>One of my primary teaching techniques is the improv-inspired â€œyes andâ€¦â€ move. People who have been trained in improvisational comedy know that the first rule is always to build on what your fellow performers say. If someone says, â€œnow weâ€™re sitting in a cafe, having coffeeâ€ you should never respond, â€œno, weâ€™re outside playing frisbee!â€ Instead, you should build, â€œyes, and the waitress is a robot!â€</p>

<p>When I was in college, I had an instructor whose response to any student comment would always start with â€œno.â€ Over the course of the semester, this became a running joke with the students in the class, because it didnâ€™t matter how right your answer was.</p>

<p>A typical example would be the instructor asking, â€œWhat programming construct am I using here?â€ A student would answer, â€œyouâ€™re using a for loopâ€ And the response would come back, â€œNo. Well, I guess it is a for loop. But I wanted you to say a control statement.â€ That oneâ€™s actually pretty tame, because both the studentâ€™s response and the instructorâ€™s expected response could be considered correct. But this instructor would go through verbal gymnastics to always start with no, even if the studentâ€™s response was precisely correct and there was no alternative.</p>

<p>As a result, many students shut down completely. Even though we joked about the instructorâ€™s love of â€œnoâ€ many people became (consciously or unconsciously) scared off from responding. By the end of the course, I was essentially the only one brave enough to raise my hand, knowing that no matter what I said I would get a negative response.</p>

<p>Of course, most teachers donâ€™t go to this extreme. But, I know how easy it is to slip into a frame of mind where you want one particular response and no one is â€œgetting it.â€ So, I make a concerted effort to always start my response to students with â€œyesâ€ or something else similarly positive. â€œSure, that model has some of the qualities Iâ€™m describing here. Thatâ€™s a nice connection to the stuff we were talking about last week. I was looking for one of the models weâ€™ve been discussing today. Does anyone have another idea?â€ In fact, I try to start with something positive, even if the answer is partly/mostly wrong. For each incorrect response, I try to put myself into my studentâ€™s frame of mind and figure out what the connection is that made them say it.</p>

<p>If I go through several responses and no one is saying what I expected, Iâ€™ll eventually say something like, â€œoh boy, here I go again, expecting you guys to read my mind!â€ Usually, this gets a laugh from the class. And by explicitly calling myself out when Iâ€™m asking unreasonable questions, it helps me reduce that behavior. Sometimes students can even be frustrated by my positivism, because they want to know <em>the</em> answer to the question. Since Iâ€™ll talk my way through almost any response, it detracts from the idea of a correct response. While I try to strike a balance, I think that the idea of many correct responses is very statistical.</p>
