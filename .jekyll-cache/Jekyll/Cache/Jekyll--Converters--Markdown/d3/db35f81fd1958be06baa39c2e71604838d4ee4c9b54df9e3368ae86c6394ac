I"x<p>Now that I am at Smith, I am technically an “isolated” statistician. It’s a funny term, because I don’t feel isolated. I have great colleagues in the Statistical and Data Sciences program (<a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/~bbaumer/">Ben Baumer</a>, <a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcrouser/">Jordan Crouser</a> and <a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/faculty_halvorsen.php">Katherine Halverson</a>), although I am the only person with a PhD in statistics. However, there is a great mailing list for isostats and a few local meetings, so I am happy to accept the designation if it means I get to participate in these great discussions, many of which are teaching-oriented.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I got to go to my first NEISM (New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting). It was great fun, and as always I got more out of the experience by livetweeting it.</p>
