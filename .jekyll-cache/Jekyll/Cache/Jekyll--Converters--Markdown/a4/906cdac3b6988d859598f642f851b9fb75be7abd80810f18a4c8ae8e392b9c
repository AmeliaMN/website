I"Ù<p>I was going to title this post something like â€œday 3â€ or â€œday 23â€ but itâ€™s hard to say where I should start counting. Whatever the number, itâ€™s clear that Iâ€™m a fresh graduate student, and barely know what Iâ€™m in for.</p>

<p>We had our first day of classes on Friday, and Iâ€™m just sitting down to my first couple of light readings. So far, Iâ€™m delighted. Our upcoming seminar speaker is involved with just the sort of data visualization I am interested in (mostly spatial, geographic visualizations) so Iâ€™m very excited to hear his talk and get to meet him at the session afterward. The motivational readings for my programming class are discussing what constitutes a â€œdocumentâ€ and what â€œinformationâ€ really means. Everything meshes with my liberal arts sensibility. I know that grad school is going to be full of hard math, but theyâ€™re easing us into it so nicely!</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, the name of this blog is a reference to Ian Stewartâ€™s Letters to a Young Mathematician, which Iâ€™m re-reading at the moment. Iâ€™m hoping my blog will contain the same sort of useful insights about a career in the mathematical sciences, without succumbing to the tactic of a narratee.</p>
