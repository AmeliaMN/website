I"Ð<p>This weekend, we had our fourth annual <a href="http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/groups/datafest/">DataFest</a> event at UCLA. DataFest is a weekend-long data hackathon, where we give students an interesting dataset, plenty of snacks, and a space to work, and they try to come up with insights. This was the third year I attended, and it seems to just get bigger and better every time. We had about 140 undergraduates from all around Southern California this year. Groups came from UCLA, USC, Cal Poly SLO, UC Riverside, and Pomona College. Our data sponsor was <a href="http://www.gridpoint.com/">GridPoint</a>, an energy-management company. They provide a service that is similar to the <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a> (my simplistic interpretation), and they gave us tons of data for the students to analyze. I signed an NDA, so I shouldnâ€™t be very specific about the contents of their proprietary dataset, but students were able to find tons of cool insights.</p>
