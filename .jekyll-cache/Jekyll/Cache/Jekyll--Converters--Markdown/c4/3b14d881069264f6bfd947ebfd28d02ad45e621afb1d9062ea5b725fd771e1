I"*<p>I’m currently at <a href="https://openvisconf.com/">OpenVisConf</a> and in awe of my fellow presenters. I did my presentation, “Do you know Nothing when you see it?” before lunch and have been slowly unwinding since then. A couple people asked for links to my slides and resources, so here they are!</p>

<p>I saved my Keynote slides as HTML and posted them on my website. They seem even lower quality than in Keynote (how is that possible?!) but you can access them  <a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/OpenVisConf">here</a>.</p>
