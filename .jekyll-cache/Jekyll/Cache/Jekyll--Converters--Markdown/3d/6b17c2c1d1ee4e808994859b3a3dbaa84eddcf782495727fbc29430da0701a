I"<p>One of the most interesting sessions I attended at ICOTS was the panel session, <a href="http://icots.info/9/session.php?s=9H">Future trends for technology in statistics education</a>. The panel was chaired by <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Chris&amp;surname=Wild" title="Chris Wild">Chris Wild</a> of Auckland, and featured</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/~nhorton/" title="Nick Horton">Nick Horton</a>, Smith College</li>
  <li><a href="http://cadrek12.org/users/william-finzer" title="Bill Finzer">Bill Finzer</a>, Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP)/Fathom</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~west/" title="Webster West">Webster West</a>, Texas A&amp;M/StatCrunch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because I was so fascinated by the discussion, I ended up creating an almost-complete transcript of the discussion (biased by my personal interests, of course). I thought it was possible that someone else might be interested in my transcript, so I’m posting it here. Beyond my own interest bias, I’m sure that I’ve mis-attributed an idea here and there. Please let me know if there’s something I should change to be closer to the truth!</p>
