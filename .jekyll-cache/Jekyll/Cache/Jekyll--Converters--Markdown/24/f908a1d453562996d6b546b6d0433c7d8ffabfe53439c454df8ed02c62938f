I"ú<p>I was joking at lunch with some colleagues that I should have a few of my favorite papers linked on the main page of my website, so when I reference them for the n^th time, I can just say â€œlook at my websiteâ€ instead of promising to email them. While I donâ€™t think itâ€™s reasonable to put this on my front page, hereâ€™s the current list of my â€œhave you read [x]?â€ papers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/ecoop12.pdf">Evaluating the Design of the R Language</a>: Iâ€™ll admit, I donâ€™t understand everything thatâ€™s in this paper. And it certainly wasnâ€™t necessary to sell me on R! But, I interact with a lot of computer scientists who ask me â€œwhy R?â€ and this paper seems to be a much better answer than anything I manage to come up with.</li>
  <li><a href="ftp://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/stat/tukey/memo/techtools.html">Technical Tools of Statistics</a>: Tukeyâ€™s vision of the future, from the 1960s. Interesting because weâ€™re <strong>still</strong> trying to figure this stuff out.</li>
  <li><a href="http://softwarestudies.com/cultural_analytics/Six_Provocations_for_Big_Data.pdf">Six Provocations for Big Data</a>: This article, by danah boyd and Kate Crawford, gives a great response to the buzzword trend of â€œBig Data.â€</li>
  <li><a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-DataWrangling-IVJ.pdf">Research Directions in Data Wrangling</a>: Just a great paper summing up some directions for research/development in the realm of data processes.</li>
  <li><a href="http://jonathanstray.com/papers/wickham.pdf">Graphical Inference for InfoVis</a>: Using an array of plots, most of them with â€œnullâ€ data, to determine if patterns youâ€™re seeing are real or just the result of randomness.</li>
