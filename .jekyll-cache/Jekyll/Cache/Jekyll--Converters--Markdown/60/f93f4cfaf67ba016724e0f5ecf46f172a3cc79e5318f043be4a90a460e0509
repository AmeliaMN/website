I"Ã<p>Last month, I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/">eyeo festival</a> as a student volunteer. For me, one of the most useful parts of the festival was the <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/code-ed-summit/">Code+ed Summit</a>, which took place on the day before the official conference opening.</p>

<p>This was the second annual meeting of the summit (which I also attended last year) and itâ€™s organized as an un-conference/wiki-style conference, meaning that thereâ€™s no set schedule when you arrive. Instead, the participants build the schedule as they arrive, writing down topics they want to talk about themselves or things theyâ€™d like to hear others discuss.</p>
