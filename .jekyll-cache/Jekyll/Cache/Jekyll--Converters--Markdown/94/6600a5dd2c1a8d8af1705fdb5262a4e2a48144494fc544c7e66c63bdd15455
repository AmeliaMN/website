I"¼<p>One of my primary teaching techniques is the improv-inspired â€œyes andâ€¦â€ move. People who have been trained in improvisational comedy know that the first rule is always to build on what your fellow performers say. If someone says, â€œnow weâ€™re sitting in a cafe, having coffeeâ€ you should never respond, â€œno, weâ€™re outside playing frisbee!â€ Instead, you should build, â€œyes, and the waitress is a robot!â€</p>

<p>When I was in college, I had an instructor whose response to any student comment would always start with â€œno.â€ Over the course of the semester, this became a running joke with the students in the class, because it didnâ€™t matter how right your answer was.</p>
