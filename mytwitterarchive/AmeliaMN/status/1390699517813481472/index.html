  	      This blew up! I stand by everything I said in-thread about the benefits of removing "tracking," but I have a couple more thoughts about the data science aspect of this proposal. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/1390370910377431040">https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/1390370910377431040</a>

  	      The first version of this proposal was released sometime mid-2020, and I completely missed the discussion by statisticians and data scientists about the content. In that draft, the authors failed to recognize, use or cite the GAISE guidelines <a href="https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Publications/Q-and-As/GAISE-II-A-Guideline-for-Precollege-Statistics-and-Data-Science-Education.aspx">https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Publications/Q-and-As/GAISE-II-A-Guideline-for-Precollege-Statistics-and-Data-Science-Education.aspx</a>

  	      Apparently, while I was burning out on online teaching in October 2020, other statisticians were writing to the CA board of education telling them that the proposal was missing key components!

  	      As a result of all the feedback, this new draft of the guidelines takes some of the elements of GAISE into account. However, even this draft is somewhat lacking in specificity about data science. Much of the material looks more like applied math (also cool!) than data science.

  	      It seems bizarre to me that the state of California missed out on consulting the heavy-hitting experts on data science education that were right in their midst. Bargagliotti teaches at @LoyolaMarymount and Gould at @UCLA.

  	      And of course, there is already a full-year data science curriculum at the high school level, which has been approved by the UCOP for years. I helped write the @uclaIDS curriculum, which has been used by hundreds of teachers and thousands of students in public schools across CA.

  	      Sadly, I suspect that the oversight of these experts and existing materials was political-- but not in the way you might think. There has long been contention between mathematicians and statisticians, and this proposal seems like a continuation of that.

  	      But, we get the best results when we work together! If you want to provide critique of the plan, I recommend focusing on the need to bring stats and data science education experts into the fold. There are lots of us! I'll be emailing mathframework@cde.ca.gov to offer my expertise
