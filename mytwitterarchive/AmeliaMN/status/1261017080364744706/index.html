  	      I had been in LA about a year when one of my best friends (@alexandrabyrne) came out to visit me. Before her visit, she asked me if we would see any celebrities. No, I said. I rarely see any celebrities. You and I will not see any celebrities.

  	      She comes out to LA, and I, wanting to be a good friend, thought about how we might end up seeing a Kardashian. I know almost nothing about them, but decided that driving up to Calabasas to go to their boutique, Dash, where they sometimes filmed, would be the only option.

  	      I didn't own a car at the time, so I guess I must have rented one for the week? Anyway, we drive up to Calabasas. LA traffic is thankfully fading from my memory these days, but it must have been at least an hour drive.

  	      We arrive just after the boutique has closed, and look through the window at the models/employees. No Kardashians. We eat some mediocre Chinese food in an eccentrically-decorated restaurant. It seems that the dream is dead.

  	      Sure enough, not that much later Kim emerges from the store, with her then-fiance Kris Humphries and her mom, Kris Jenner. We didn't interact with them at all, just watched them get into their luxury SUV and drive off.

  	      But, I think this may have been a peak experience in Alex's life. Even for me, someone who knew next to nothing about any of those people, it was pretty fantastic. A friend comes to visit, asks to see a particular celebrity, and then you're able to deliver?? Almost magical.
