  	      Francesca Tripodi just published an amazing paper on how Wikipedia articles about women are more frequently mis-categorized as "not notable" and the additional labor it takes to combat this. You should read the paper, but here are some highlights: <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1409978235870404611-E5D5fIBXIAAlSLb.png"><img src="../../tweets_media/1409978235870404611-E5D5fIBXIAAlSLb.png"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      Wikipedia edit-a-thons aim to help people (often women) become comfortable editing Wikipedia, and combat gender bias in coverage. Tripodi did interviews with many people at edit-a-thons, and explored their experiences.

  	      Instead, the mentors for the edit-a-thons (some of whom were women) added the articles to *their* watchlists. It was common for “women being added at these events to be immediately flagged for deletion, or even sent to AfD where they would experience further sexism.”

  	      It seems that articles about women aren't necessarily being deleted more often, but they are being *nominated for deletion* more often. That's still not good, because the process of arguing against a deletion requires a ton of work and is exhausting.

  	      For almost every month in the data, Wikipedia articles about women were (statistically significantly) more likely to be nominated for deletion than articles about men. There were a few months where this wasn't the case (no significance), but with many tests we would expect that.

  	      I'll say that again: Wikipedia articles about women are more likely to be nominated for deletion than articles about men. If you have written articles about women or had students do so (as I have) this probably comes as no surprise. But, it's nice to have data to back it up.
