```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
library(skimr)
library(agricolae)
```

#### Exercise 5.24

Note: the data is not shaped correctly initially! You want a variable called `time`, but those values are caught up in the table. Try `gather` or `spread`. 

```{r}
data(FantasyBaseball)
head(FantasyBaseball)
```

#### Exercise 5.25

#### Exercise 6.23

```{r}
data(RiverElements)
head(RiverElements)
```
