```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
library(leaps)
```


#### Exercise 4.3

```{r}
data(MLB2007Standings)
head(MLB2007Standings)
MLB2007Standings <- MLB2007Standings %>%
  select(-Wins, -Losses, -Team)
```

> For part a: The answer in the back of the book is wrong (they used forward selection). I would like you to use stepwise regression, as the question asks.
> For part d, please use AIC instead of Mallow's Cp.
