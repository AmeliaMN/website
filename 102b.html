  <h1>Stat 102b</h1>
		
		<p class="lead">In Winter 2014, I TAed Stat 102b: Introduction to Computation and Optimization (Instructor: <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jsanchez/">Juana Sanchez</a>)</p>
		<h4>Office hours: </h4>
		<p>Tuesday and Friday, 2:15-3:15 pm. Find me on the 8th floor of the Math Science building in my office, 8105G. (Walk into 8105 and through the lounge)</p>
		
		<h4>Course resources: </h4>
		<ul>
		<li>The course <a href="https://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/14W-STATS102B-1">website</a>.</li>
		<li>I have my own R cheatsheet, which I've modified slightly for this class. Download it <a href="R-sheet.pdf">here</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="dayOneSlides.html">Slides</a> from the first day of discussion (with expectations, email etiquette, etc).</li>
		<li>Before the midterm, I was talking about one of my favorite ways to study-- unlimited practice problems with R! 
		For example, if you want to practice hand-computing matrix inverses, create some matrices, try their inverses, and check with R. 
		<a href="img/Discussion5.pdf">Here</a> are some problems to review for the midterm, with associated R code. Just change the code to get new problems. </li>
