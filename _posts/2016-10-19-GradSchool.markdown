It's that time of year again, the time where I find myself meeting with students thinking about graduate school in statistics. Since I often end up sending people the same things, I figured I'd pull them together into a blog post. You probably already know about [the grad cafe](https://thegradcafe.com/), [the professor is in](http://theprofessorisin.com/pearlsofwisdom/), and [PhD comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php). These other links might not be as common.

### Q: What is grad school in statistics like? 

### A: Here are some resources to help you get a taste:

- When I was still in graduate school, I wrote a three-part blog series for [datascience.la](http://datascience.la) on graduate school: [Statistics grad school-- what is it really like?](http://datascience.la/statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/), [Part 2 of what statistics grad school is like](http://datascience.la/part-2-of-statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/), and [Part 3: Paying for statistics graduate school](http://datascience.la/paying-for-statistics-grad-school-aka-the/). 
- I gave some additional advice in this recent [interview](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2016/09/01/inspire/) in AmstatNews. 
- [Michael Lopez](https://statsbylopez.com/about/) also has a piece called [So you want a graduate degree in statistics?](https://statsbylopez.com/2014/07/23/so-you-want-a-graduate-degree-in-statistics/), with sections on deciding on a program, thriving once you are there, and much more. He goes in to the difference between biostatistics and statistics, a PhD and an MA, and how to evaluate programs. 


### Q: Where should I go for grad school?

### A: Wherever seems like a good fit! 

I really think statistics is such an in-demand field that you can get a job with a degree from virtually any school. These show my personal research interests and biases, but a couple of my favorite programs to recommend to students are:

- [Statistics at Iowa State](http://stat.iastate.edu/). This is where [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/knitr/) got their PhDs, and current students include [Carson Sievert](http://cpsievert.github.io/about/), [Maggie Johnson](https://twitter.com/maggiejohnsonmn), [Andee Kaplan](http://andeekaplan.com/), [Samantha Tyner](http://sctyner.github.io/), and [Eric Hare](http://erichare.me/). Notable faculty include [Hieke Hofmann](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/) and [Ulrike Genschel](http://ugenschel.github.io/). [Update, 11/27/17, I believe *all* of those students now have PhDs!]
- [Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html). This is where [Hilary Parker](https://twitter.com/hspter), [Alyssa Frazee](https://twitter.com/acfrazee) and [Jenna Krall](http://jennakrall.com/) got their PhDs. Notable faculty include [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/), [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/), and [Brian Caffo](http://www.bcaffo.com/) (of [Coursera data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science/1) fame).
- [University of Washington Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/). Not exactly a grad program, because it involves people from both computer science and the school of information, but does awesome work. Notable students include [Arvind Satyanarayan](http://arvindsatya.com/) [Update 11/27/17, he has his PhD!], and faculty include [Jeff Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) of the computer science department and [Jessica Hullman](http://faculty.washington.edu/jhullman/) in the iSchool. 

Fun fact I recently learned-- Iowa State was the first US university with a department of statistics, and Johns Hopkins the first (in the world?) to offer biostatistics!

### Q: How do I get in to grad school?

### A: You need lots of things to be a strong candidate, including:

- good (but not necessarily perfect) grades
- a decent GRE score (particularly on the quantitative section of the regular GRE)
- a compelling story in your personal statement (email me if you want to read mine, I don't feel like posting it on the web)
- solid letters of recommendation, particularly from faculty members who know you well from a variety of contexts, like class, research, etc. 
- I also always recommend reaching out to people from the program you are applying to, whether current grad students, alumni, or professors to get a better sense of a program and whether you would be a good fit. [Female Science Professor](http://science-professor.blogspot.com/) has [a great post](http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2011/10/writing-to-me-reprise.html) about what to say (and not to say) in an email to a professor. 


### Q: How do I succeed in grad school?

### A: I recommend the following:

- [How to Prep for Grad School if You're Poor](http://howtoprepforgradschoolwhilepoor.wikispaces.com/)- a wiki with some information about the application process, but mostly the "cultural capital" you might not have that could be useful when you're in grad school. 
- [Doing research](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/how.2b/how.2b.research.html)- how to do research (the short story: do a little every day). 
- [A thesis proposal is a contract](http://matt.might.net/articles/advice-for-phd-thesis-proposals/). Or at least, it should be. 
- [Write the paper first](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html)- an idea about how to frame your work by writing the paper first. 
- [Oral exams](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/oralexams.html)- this is specifically about advancing to candidacy at UCLA in statistics, but I've sent it to friends in other programs who don't have similar guidelines. 
- Leek Group Guides to [reviewing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews), [data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), [writing your first paper](https://github.com/jtleek/firstpaper), or [reading papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers). 

### Q: How can I learn more?

### A: I recommend getting involved in some online communities. 

- There is a ton of activity in statistics and data science on twitter. Most of the faculty and students I mentioned above have twitter accounts (some linked above, the others easy to find), and if you are into R you can get a taste by looking at the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash) and [#tidyverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash) hashtags. 
- Roger Peng and Jeff Leek (mentioned above) and [Rafa Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) have a blog called [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/) with all sorts of interesting statistics discussions.
- Hilary Parker and Roger Peng (mentioned above) have a podcast called [Not so standard devations](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/09/17/not-so-standard-deviations-the-podcast/), available on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570?mt=2), and many more podcast distributors.
