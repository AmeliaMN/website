I was just listening to "Nothing Better" by The Postal Service on Pandora and was amused to hear for the first time the lyric, 
> I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.
>I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave. 

Hopefully I can find more songs that reference data visualization and prepare a playlist!
