I'm now involved in the recently-launched [datascience.la](datascience.la) blog. While you'll probably be drawn to the site for the [useR! conference session videos](http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/sessions/), [interviews with data scientists](http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/interviews/), and meetup announcements, there's going to be much more!

I've posted [Data Science Goes to College with DataFest](http://datascience.la/data-science-goes-to-college-with-datafest/), yet another summary of the yearly DataFest we hold at UCLA and that's going national. 

Then, I wrote [Statistics Grad School-- What is it Really Like?](http://datascience.la/statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/) describing some of the experience of getting a PhD in statistics at UCLA.

Finally, I'll be giving a talk at this month's DataVis LA meetup, [Eyeo Festival Highlights](http://datascience.la/datavis-la-meetup-eyeo-festival-highlights-august-26/) on August 26th. Come by Cornerstone OnDemand to hear me talk about the things that inspired me the most from the [eyeo festival](http://eyeofestival.com/).
