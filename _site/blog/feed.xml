				<title>OpenVisConf talk transcript</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvisconf.com&quot;&gt;OpenVisConf&lt;/a&gt;, I hurriedly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/blog/conferences/2016/04/25/OpenVisConf.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; some links from my talk so people could follow up with resources I had mentioned. I kept meaning to write up a fuller blog post, but of course life comes along (in the interim, Smith has finished finals, I&amp;#39;ve graded a ton of projects, gone out of the state twice, and attended commencement). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvisconf.com/#transcripts&quot;&gt;official transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the conference were posted, I knew I&amp;#39;d struck gold. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Asignia&quot;&gt;Amanda Lundberg&lt;/a&gt; was the transcriptionist, and she did a fantastic job. The transcripts are provided with a creative commons license, so I grabbed the text from my talk, edited it a bit, and stuck in some images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite interesting to read the transcripts as-is. I know Amanda edited out a lot of &amp;quot;um&amp;quot;s and &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot;s as everyone was speaking, but a person&amp;#39;s verbal tics still get through. In my case, I say &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; a LOT. Some of those have been removed here for ease of reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more interesting note, the organizers used TF-IDF to identify unique words and bi-grams from each talk. Mine make it &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; clear I&amp;#39;m a statistician. Words like &amp;quot;distribution&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;statistic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;observed difference&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bootstrap&amp;quot; all appeared more in my talk than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/text_viz.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;tf-idf&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Talk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the easiest way to tell what the heck I&amp;#39;m talking about is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hps9r7JZQP8&quot;&gt;watch the video of my talk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hps9r7JZQP8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if you&amp;#39;re video-resistant (I usually am) this will probably give you the flavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of my talk is &amp;quot;Do you know Nothing when you see it?&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_i/66962027/in/photolist-6VctH-zr4aM-e9mH1t-6XLhY9-qo4Bms-8gyi5q-zr357-4jeF2Y-r8nhEr-3BzwrF-hWLU1-zhqjfS-6akRDL-8oHoz1-Env5V-dLro6N-6Ba6Qx-hcQm7X-45WiW8-45Wj1K-nWoLpt-8Qp68q-6a6dd5-aqc1Ri-dZmw2h-79ykph-rxzvJj-uu5px-JCCFC-9tWqkt-6EGjEv-6Juo8s-eCaru-6VMiSX-dSGL3M-6bsbPs-8cueSK-4waMSd-7zWdYW-5WrAQr-MtpXy-6gH759-MtpXJ-a7uXuC-4THFy2-69GvS-GyDeK-EntY3-a1bJ4u-8HgEn&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/titleslide.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;TV static&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say nothing, I don&amp;#39;t mean nothing like television static, because that&amp;#39;s actually not nothing, that&amp;#39;s something. It&amp;#39;s the image, it just got garbled when it was going through the air. I mean something more like this, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/randomness.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;random noise&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but not really even this, because this is random noise that I generated with my computer. It&amp;#39;s pseudo-random, and probably your awesome human brain is finding patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;http://deepdreamgenerator.com/&quot;&gt;DeepDream&lt;/a&gt; already. You can see the bunnies and hearts and clouds in my random data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to be able to identify when something we created is nothing. And in order to do that, I&amp;#39;m going try statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/standback.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Stand back, I&#39;m going to try... statistics&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a statistics professor. That means whenever I get in front of a group of people, I try to sneakily teach them some statistics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, &lt;strong&gt;what is statistics about?&lt;/strong&gt; And it&amp;#39;s about many things. It&amp;#39;s about variation, which is one of the main themes we&amp;#39;re going to talk about here. Sometimes there&amp;#39;s modeling-- I&amp;#39;m going to ignore modeling almost completely. And when you take an intro stat class or if you&amp;#39;re doing basic science, you&amp;#39;re often asking are these two numbers different? Another way of saying is, is this one number, the difference, different than zero? Sometimes you want to know, this number, what are some other reasonable numbers we could have seen if we hadn&amp;#39;t seen this one? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to answer those questions, we need context about the variation. The first example that came to mind when I was preparing this talk was ants. I don&amp;#39;t know why. Imagine you had some ants, and you had some big-looking ants and little-looking ants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ants&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/bareego/6657872621/in/photolist-b9kkzg-325Ep2-eYdznk-9SBTFj-6tWfjj-6oC1yN-8TifHh-6iAU8p-5nWn6B-6MBDMu-BoQci-dUyXLF-9QxFLR-a51iiR-4V4xA1-558iot-g7NJrP-fktCLP-xhLeW-6sN6Mo-8v9u8H-ozavpA-4eTAda-prJXTS-4ZSm8T-9AbyuJ-YTmUb-bzKnV-4dyx2v-2ZicrS-5Tu9ez-6h1U6q-6i17hn-7iuuib-kAkPyY-n4U475-5qduaP-N4Ws3-qjGbCr-osHjb-tEsAP-3UN759-o76HA-7KjG9k-67edp-xdMVP5-6zLxaT-pgWHT-8k3imL-smJAAa/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/bareego.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Big ant&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:5px; overflow:hidden;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/duncan/3189039332/in/photolist-5RNEhL-rZEoXK-nYZLfC-6nmrKx-pY9yMV-eRhnD5-pSNaGV-6ofFu5-et6vZ7-oD6Ho2-a272Uq-drzFK2-a95asp-nvsEmF-6fVHz9-36MAEJ-9Y51BL-3wGr3i-2KZa9r-6wfRXP-81NL4r-8xKxZp-6nTDi1-9XUUEw-5do5mX-opjwhP-o4kqqh-aaYVKv-83tTzL-c9T3bY-6FyRKs-6sJfKz-eXfmX9-nJttup-4R4gHx-6FyRLq-bMSpZK-5rueY2-6o9yu6-a6ZWN6-bGsWE6-6K9QaB-nJtF1m-69MiSx-bq4sGw-2KZa9M-8gkRfi-nHzf5N-am8cba-4VKSnJ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/duncan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Smaller ants&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you thought maybe I got unlucky-- I got five big-looking ants and five little-looking ants, but really they&amp;#39;re both draws from the same population. And overall the groups don&amp;#39;t have any difference in size. But, you observed differences in the group sizes of three-quarters of an inch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and I know something about ant size variation. That sounds very large, and we&amp;#39;ll see that it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another context, imagine you had some a tug of war game set up, you had two teams. There&amp;#39;s men and women split up into the blue and the pink team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/illinoisspringfield/17617323816/in/album-72157652398690788/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/illinoisspringfield.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Blue team&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/illinoisspringfield/8686873531/in/album-72157633316473571/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/illinoisspringfield2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Pink team&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mapped their heights, we found the average height, and we learned the average height between the groups was different. Again, we observed a difference of about three quarters of an inch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to know, is that significant? Are those two teams really different, or did we just observe a difference by nature of the selection process? The random generation we&amp;#39;re assuming is happening behind the scenes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve taken a standard statistics class, you&amp;#39;re now thinking about confidence intervals. You&amp;#39;re thinking &amp;quot;point estimate, plus or minus the standard error times something that has to do with some distribution&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/CI_mean.gif&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;point estimate, plus or minus the standard error times something that has to do with some distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe you&amp;#39;re thinking about some pages in your textbook that had standard error calculations, with a bunch of square roots and fractions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/SE_page1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Standard error forumas&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re thinking about a difference of means. So, we think, we can just pick that first formula. But really, it&amp;#39;s worse than that. There&amp;#39;s all these different proofs about if you have different group sizes, and if the variances are different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/SE_page2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Standard error forumas&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then you need to pick that formula out. And then it is worse than &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;, because once you have the standard error calculation, you have to know the degrees of freedom you&amp;#39;re going to look at in your distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/SE_page3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Standard error forumas&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even I-- I have a Ph.D. in statistics-- I get the heebie-jeebies if you ask me to come up with the right standard error computation. Maybe you&amp;#39;re better at statistics than me, and came up with the right standard error, found the degrees of freedom. Now you&amp;#39;re going to look at some idealized distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Student_t_pdf.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;T distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this a sampling distribution. It&amp;#39;s not a distribution of data, it&amp;#39;s a distribution of statistics. Statistics are numbers computed from other numbers. In this case we had the average heights of the two tug of war teams and we&amp;#39;re looking at their difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your standard error and your degrees of freedom and the distribution, you could come up with some confidence interval and you could see if there was really no relationship between the team and the height, how often would we observe a difference of three-quarters of an inch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to argue that&amp;#39;s not the way you should do that problem. Instead, you should use randomization. And randomization is just what it sounds. You have two things you think might have a relationship. You want to come up with the sampling distribution, and you want it to be the null distribution. The distribution of, essentially, nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you&amp;#39;re going to do is you&amp;#39;re going to take the values, the labels here, and you&amp;#39;re going to mix them up. You&amp;#39;re going to compute the group height means for those different groups in the mixed-up data and compute the difference in the heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can see already sometimes you&amp;#39;re getting a positive difference, sometimes you&amp;#39;re getting a negative difference. I think one of those turned out to be zero. We&amp;#39;re going to do this like a thousand times and then we can look at the distribution of that statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/randomization.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Randomization distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distribution is centered around zero because it&amp;#39;s a null distribution. And then we can calculate where is 95% of the data? What&amp;#39;s the middle 95%? And then sort of say &amp;quot;if there really was no difference between the heights of these two tug of war teams, what sorts of differences might we observe?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so in the case of the tug of war teams, if there was really no difference, we could observe height differences that were negative four inches to positive four inches different. Our observed difference of three quarters of an inch is so tiny we think it is nothing. Even though we saw a difference of three-quarters of an inch, that was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the ants, same thing, but the distribution looks different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/randomizationants.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Randomization distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randomization distributions are not always symmetric. And they&amp;#39;re not always smooth. They can have these lumps. But, again, we can compute where the middle 95% of the data is. So for the ants it goes from negative 0.5 to 0.5. The observed difference of three-quarters of an inch, that would be pretty weird to see if there was no difference between my two different ant size groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a statistician, so the open source programming language of my choice is R. If you wanted to do this yourself in R, this is the code you would use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r, eval=FALSE&quot; data-lang=&quot;r, eval=FALSE&quot;&gt;library(mosaic)
diff(mean(~height|team, data=tugowar))

bootstrap &amp;lt;- do(1000) * diff(mean(~height|team, data=resample(tugowar, groups=team)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I wanted to compute one difference in means, it&amp;#39;s the first piece of code. And I wanted to do a thousand of them, I could use the second chunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s another technique we might want to use for assessing whether the number we got is sort of reasonable or what some other possible numbers we could have observed could be. That&amp;#39;s bootstrapping. In bootstrapping you take the data you have, kind of like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Making something from nothing. That&amp;#39;s not really possible, so we&amp;#39;re going to make data from our old data. We&amp;#39;re going to sample with replacement. Pull out data points. Here we&amp;#39;re not breaking the relationship between the two variables. We&amp;#39;re just pulling them out directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can see sometimes I get the same data point more than once in my bootstrap sample. But now I have new data, and I can treat that as my current data. And compute the mean heights, and then the possible difference
in heights. And so if that observed tug of war game we saw was really representative of the world, other than 0.75 I might have observed 0.6637. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can come up with a bootstrap distribution, much in the same way I can with randomization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/boostrap_dist.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Bootstrap distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bootstrap distributuon might not be symmetric. It is centered around the estimate from the real data. In this case, centered around the 0.75. And then it shows us some possible numbers we could have observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, again, if that was our data and we were generating bootstrap samples, we might have seen differences from negative 3 to positive 4, and again we think ours is not different from nothing or zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the ants, all the observed values we could have seen, they are all negative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/bootstrap_ant.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Bootstrap distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we think there is a relationship. One of those groups is bigger than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about randomization and the bootstrap, you could look at this &lt;a href=&quot;www.openintro.org&quot;&gt;open source textbook&lt;/a&gt;. What? It was written by some really cool statisticians. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenIntroOrg&quot;&gt;The source&lt;/a&gt; is all on GitHub. You can download the PDF for free. If you like physical books, you can buy this statistics textbook that I used in my class for &lt;a href=&quot;http://smile.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-Randomization-Simulation-David/dp/1500576697?sa-no-redirect=1&quot;&gt;$9 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. So it&amp;#39;s really cool and good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/openintro.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Open Intro&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want other resources, Jonathan Stray has a five minute lighting talk from NICAR, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OneWeirdStatsTrick&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Solve Every Statistics Problem with One Weird Trick&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and that one weird trick is randomization, so you kind of know about that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://jonathanstray.com/me&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/jonathan_stray.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Jonathan Stray&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Tim Hesterberg, has a paper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/KnowAboutBootstrap&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;What Teachers should know about the Bootstrap&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I think it really should be called what everyone should know about the bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://www.timhesterberg.net/home/bio&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/tim_hesterberg.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Tim Hesterberg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/howdoesitrelate.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;What does this have to do with visualization?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this all have to do with visualization? We&amp;#39;re going to try to do the same thing with visualization as we did with numbers. Try to say is this different than nothing? What are other things we could have observed? And this is going to help us try to not make visualizations that don&amp;#39;t show anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say that, I don&amp;#39;t mean visualizations of the type you see on &lt;a href=&quot;http://viz.wtf/&quot;&gt;WTF-viz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://viz.wtf/post/141788409671/lingerie-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/lingerie.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Lingerie chart?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although I like making fun of those too. And I don&amp;#39;t mean showing nothing in the way Darrell Huff is talking about in the 1950s with How to Lie with Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Huff.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Darrell Huff&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;#39;m talking about using techniques like randomization. There&amp;#39;s an awesome paper by &lt;a href=&quot;http://hadley.nz/&quot;&gt;Hadley Wickham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/%7Ebuja/&quot;&gt;Andreas Buja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dicook.github.io/&quot;&gt;Di Cook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hofmann.public.iastate.edu/&quot;&gt;Heike Hofmann&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:5px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/graphical_inference&quot;&gt;Graphical Inference for InfoVis&lt;/a&gt;. I think it&amp;#39;s really worth checking out. One of the techniques they suggest in the paper is called the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mike_crane/5188333652/in/photolist-8UtyQu-syKEK-9SHXTx-2azAWL-bCqhR4-7rSB2w-syKgn-bCqiAv-bCqhHt-bCqhWH-9WLjQh-bpvnxY-jHWcxM-bpvniA-Bh14D-bpvnCL-9VekKT-9Vh1Jo-9Vh4TS-765vEj-9Vh9Qd-bmKeHQ-ALLCXL-9Vhc17-9Veatv-oW5cC4-9VebyX-9Vef9H-9VgZFS-9Vh1wy-9VhbtN-9VekZi-9Vh2eJ-9Vh6es-9Vh1jA-9VhaeJ-9Vh8U9-9Vhaqo-9VhbLQ-9Vekxi-9Vec4p-9Vh7RL-9Vh16W-72qhos-9Vh6P5-9VgZeL-9VenuT-9Vea3D-9VeeSa-72mhJi&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/mike_crane.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Lineup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the lineup is you put your data, your plot that you think shows something real, in a lineup with a bunch of innocent plots. If you can pick your accused plot out of the lineup of innocent plots, that means that it&amp;#39;s somehow different than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, I would break the relationship between X and Y and look at what other plots I could have gotten from the same data with that relationship broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/random6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Random plot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at them all in sequence, I want to look at them all together. Let&amp;#39;s take an example. This is some data about loans. And I&amp;#39;m plotting the balance of a loan against the income. And I&amp;#39;m coloring by whether or not a person defaulted on their loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/default.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Loan defaults&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my human brain sees a pattern. I say, it looks like people who default on loans are the ones that have really high loan balances. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they&amp;#39;re rich or poor, it&amp;#39;s just those high loan balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible I just sort of made that up? This is what it would look like if you use the protocol in the graphical inference paper and look at the plots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/default_perm.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Loan defaults in lineup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s 20 plots, because we often use a standard p-value cutoff of 0.05, which is the same as one out of 20. If you guessed randomly, you&amp;#39;d get the right one 1 out of 20 times even guessing at random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with this one I think you can probably identify which is the real plot. Part of it is I showed you the real one before. You might have recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice you shouldn&amp;#39;t look at the accused plot alone before you look at it in the lineup. So either you should build this into your workflow, looking at a lineup of plots every time you make a visualization, or more realistically, if you make a plot and think it might sort of show nothing, make a lineup and show it to someone who hasn&amp;#39;t seen the original plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r, eval=FALSE&quot; data-lang=&quot;r, eval=FALSE&quot;&gt;library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Default)+
  geom_point(aes(x=balance, y=income, col=default))

library(nullabor)
ggplot(lineup(null_permute(&#39;default&#39;), Default))+
geom_point(aes(x=balance, y=income, col=default)) +
 facet_wrap(~.sample)

decrypt(&quot;OlCE bQTQ Aw GWPATAWw d&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re an R person, this is familiar. This is the ggplot code to make a scatterplot. And the bottom is to randomize the data to make null plots. I&amp;#39;m doing a null permute on the label of default versus not default and
wrapping those facets into an array of plots. When you run the code, they have done a clever thing, it will make a plot in your plotting window, but also prints this text in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says decrypt and then it&amp;#39;s a bunch of nonsense characters. And that&amp;#39;s where they hid the answer. So if you were doing this on your computer and you wanted to not know ahead of time which was the real plot, but figure it out afterward, this is how to do it. You take the piece of code, and run the code, tells you where the true data was. So in this case we got it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r, eval=FALSE&quot; data-lang=&quot;r, eval=FALSE&quot;&gt;decrypt(&quot;OlCE bQTQ Aw GWPATAWw d&quot;)
[1] &quot;True data in position 14&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the same code for the t-test. This is the tug of war teams again. Somewhere in there I&amp;#39;ve hidden the real plot of the different heights. The crosses represent the mean heights for each of the groups. The question is if you can pick out the real data. So in your head, make your guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/visual_t2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Visual t-test&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says decrypt, if you&amp;#39;re good at decrypting quickly, you could see what it is. But the true data is in position 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r, eval=FALSE&quot; data-lang=&quot;r, eval=FALSE&quot;&gt;decrypt(&quot;OlCE bQTQ Aw GWPATAWw J&quot;)
[1] &quot;True data in position 5&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the one I picked out. Certainly not the most extreme of the possible plots. What this is telling me is the same thing as the permutation test I did with the statistics and the distribution at the beginning of the talk. There really isn&amp;#39;t a difference between these two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve given you a positive example and a negative one. But this one, I don&amp;#39;t think you really needed visualization to tell you that answer. You could have used standard statistics. The power of the graphical inference technique, is it&amp;#39;s generalizable. You can use it for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing where I think humans are great at finding patterns in noise is in time series analysis. This is about the steps I take. So it&amp;#39;s from my FitBit. And sometimes I like to make up stories, like the variance is going up. Or the mean seems like it&amp;#39;s changing. Or something happened in December. I&amp;#39;m really good at making up those stories about the distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/ts.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Time series&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, the real data is in there. Again, look at it and try to see if you can guess which one it is. And now we&amp;#39;re going to try and decrypt. So there&amp;#39;s the string again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r, eval=FALSE&quot; data-lang=&quot;r, eval=FALSE&quot;&gt;decrypt(&quot;OlCE bQTQ Aw GWPATAWw y&quot;)
[1] &quot;True data in position 4&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says the true data is in position 4. Again, that wasn&amp;#39;t the one I had picked out. But if I had just shown you the one time series plot, you would have believed my stories about what was interesting about that plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the statistics analog, we&amp;#39;ve been doing the &amp;quot;is this different than zero?&amp;quot; task. Now I want to switch to the &amp;quot;what are some other reasonable values we could have gotten for this?&amp;quot; task. So with the numbers, that was what are some other reasonable values we could have gotten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I&amp;#39;m going to talk about that in terms of plots. So some of this comes from joint work with a colleague of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vpri.org/html/team_bios/aran_lunzer.htm&quot;&gt;Aran Lunzer&lt;/a&gt;, we worked together at the Communications Design Group. This is the highest quality image of Aran I could find. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://www.vpri.org/html/team_bios/aran_lunzer.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/397f9d5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Aran Lunzer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s almost life size in the theater, so maybe that&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked on a tool, a prototype tool, and we called it &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/93535802&quot;&gt;LivelyR&lt;/a&gt;. This is real in the sense that if you go on GitHub and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aranlunzer/shiny&quot;&gt;download the code&lt;/a&gt; you could run it yourself. I don&amp;#39;t recommend it. It&amp;#39;s very buggy. But it really has &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; on the back end and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lively-web.org&quot;&gt;LivelyWeb&lt;/a&gt; and javascript on the front end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/93535802&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/93535802&quot;&gt;LivelyR introductory demo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user27554411&quot;&gt;Aran Lunzer&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets you play with the bin width and bin offset of a histogram. Many things let you do this, but this also lets you overlay a sweep of parameter values. So you can see a variety of histograms with the same bin width and slightly different bin offsets. And they form what I like to call a histogram cloud. Which is like a kernel density estimate, but easier for people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one more feature we built into this, which is you can call out the individual histograms if you want to. Instead of seeing them overlaid as a cloud, you could do small multiples. And it&amp;#39;s actually a two-hand
interaction here. There&amp;#39;s an iPad and you&amp;#39;re controlling the one screen with your right hand and the other with your left hand. So it&amp;#39;s a little bit buggy. But you can see the small multiples of the different possibilities of histograms you could have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I think it&amp;#39;s really easy with histograms to use the default algorithm, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram&quot;&gt;Sturges algorithm&lt;/a&gt; or whatever it is in your favorite tool, which will make the bin widths for you. If you&amp;#39;re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ggplot2.org/&quot;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;, it will give you a warning, like, I chose a default but you should come up with something better. But, many people don&amp;#39;t. I know that you all do, because you&amp;#39;re visualization professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not always obvious to non-professionals that those defaults make a huge difference. You might use the defaults and find what looks like a pattern, but it&amp;#39;s really just the result of the parameter values you chose. So giving people the opportunity to play with the parameters is really powerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Aran and I did this work in one dimension, looking at the histograms. I started thinking how could we do this in two dimensions? Which got me thinking about maps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/maup16&quot;&gt;Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem&lt;/a&gt; says that if you aggregate spatial data in different polygonal shapes, you&amp;#39;re going to get different spatial patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/maup16&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/MAUP.gif&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can happen with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/exp_gerrymander&quot;&gt;gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/exp_gerrymander&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/gerrymandering.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Gerrymandering&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can happen with different county and zip code data, these different levels of polygons. And there are a lot of statistical problems that go along with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aran Lunzer and I worked together on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/spatial_agg&quot;&gt;this next tool&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn&amp;#39;t really have a name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/spatial_agg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/spatial_agg.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Spatial aggregation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes point data about earthquakes in southern California and aggregates them into polygons. But instead of making fixed polygons, you can scale and rotate and move the polygons to see some other possible values of the visualization you could have gotten. So you start with your default values and maybe you think there are very obvious trends everyone should be aware of. You can tell some great story about why there is a hot spot of earthquakes in this one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then when you start manipulating the polygons, you can see there are many other possible patterns you could have created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sjrohde/4687848929&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/sjrohde.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Nothing, AZ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want you to take away from this talk is that there are statistical tasks and very analogous visualization tasks. In statistics we want to know if two numbers are different, which is like knowing if one number is different than zero. We could use tools like randomization to answer that question. In the visualization world we can use randomization in a different way to answer the question, is this plot different than nothing? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In statistics we might want to ask, what are some reasonable, other possible values for this number? What other differences in heights could we have observed? And you can use something like the bootstrap to show you other possible reasonable values. In the visualization space, using parameter manipulation, or giving users the ability to see how your parameter choices impact the visual story they are seeing can be really powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Do you know Nothing when you see it?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvisconf.com/&quot;&gt;OpenVisConf&lt;/a&gt; and in awe of my fellow presenters. I did my presentation, &amp;quot;Do you know Nothing when you see it?&amp;quot; before lunch and have been slowly unwinding since then. A couple people asked for links to my slides and resources, so here they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved my Keynote slides as HTML and posted them on my website. They seem even lower quality than in Keynote (how is that possible?!) but you can access them  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/OpenVisConf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s wrong with being data-collecting pigeons?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As you might know from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/blog/visualization/2015/01/14/FitbitColors.html&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/484751171374948353&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ve been a Fitbit person since December 2013. I&amp;#39;m also very interested in participatory sensing and citizen science, and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about the ways that data can be used for good, both on the personal and societal level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fitbit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2014, I set up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/recipes/173925-document-your-daily-activity-in-a-google-spreadsheet&quot;&gt;IFTTT recipe&lt;/a&gt; to save my step data into a google spreadsheet every day. So, I have almost two years worth of data to play with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/steps.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;My step habits&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I get an average of 10,000 steps a day, with quite a bit of variance. I hadn&amp;#39;t realized this until recently, but it seems like since I moved from LA to Northampton (August 2015) I&amp;#39;ve been getting progressively fewer steps. I&amp;#39;m trying to turn that around, but it hasn&amp;#39;t quite been captured by the loess line yet! I&amp;#39;ve certainly used the Fitbit data to make micro changes on the day scale, but this is my first time using longer-term data to try to make behavior changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of hearing me talk about how useful the Fitbit feedback was, my dad recently purchased one, and he loves it. Apparently he has already changed his behavior to hit 10,000 steps a day. On the phone, he instructed me to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invent two of three more things like that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meaning simple sensor tools to help you live a better life. That&amp;#39;s a big proposition (thanks, Dad!) but I can see some interesting developments in that space lately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;WeMo Insight switch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EOEDJ9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00EOEDJ9W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=flowingdata-20&amp;linkId=PXV4IU5GIASZOPRZ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/wemo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;WeMo Insight switch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EOEDJ9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00EOEDJ9W&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=flowingdata-20&amp;amp;linkId=PXV4IU5GIASZOPRZ&quot;&gt;WeMo insight switch&lt;/a&gt;, which I heard about on Nathan Yau&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://flowingdata.com/2016/04/04/a-week-with-the-wemo-insight-switch/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. You should go read his telling of it, but it sounds like it (or tools like it) could help people keep track of their energy use and learn to use less. That seems to count as a sensor tool to help you live a better life! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pigeon Air Patrol and Plume&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pigeonairpatrol.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/plume.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Pigeon Air Patrol&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Then, I heard about the idea of personalized pollution sensors on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/NSSDeviations&quot;&gt;Not So Standard Deviations Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Roger and Hilary were discussing how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pigeonairpatrol.com/&quot;&gt;Pigeon Air Patrol&lt;/a&gt; project strapped mini air pollution sensors to trained pigeons and then let them loose in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this kind of procedure could be used to produce much more data than the official governmental sensors like those maintained by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/montring.html&quot;&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;DERFA&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case in the UK. From what I can see, it seems like the Pigeon Air Patrol was more of a publicity stunt than anything else, and the team has moved on to having humans carry the sensors in their daily lives. They successfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/crowdsource-air-pollution-in-london&quot;&gt;crowdfunded a campaign&lt;/a&gt; to create a small sensor device that can be fastened onto a person&amp;#39;s bag or bike to tract the air quality wherever they go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using participatory sensing data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways that I see participatory sensing or citizen science data collection projects being motivated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the user&amp;#39;s own edification&lt;/strong&gt;. This is how I see Fitbit. The company is probably using my data for their own purposes, but my reason for collecting step data is so that I can know more about myself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the use of researchers&lt;/strong&gt;. In this paradigm, people who participate in the project are doing it to generate data for some type of study. They may not get any direct use out of the data themselves, but they are happy to help. This is how the pigeons (presumably) felt about collecting air quality data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not clear where in this system the Plume sensor will fit. Will people be paying attention to their own personal &amp;quot;pollution dashboard&amp;quot; to see how much exposure they&amp;#39;re getting? Or are they just data-collecting pigeons helping scientists learn more about air quality? Of course, the best projects manage to do a little of both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Oldschool citizen science&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/birders-flock-to-annual-christmas-count-20141228/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/audubon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Christmas Bird Count&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The Audubon Society probably deserves the award for longest-running citizen science project, for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count&quot;&gt;Christmas Bird Count&lt;/a&gt;, which has been ongoing since 1900. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteers go out in the month of December, observe the bird species in their area, and report back to the Audubon. In a similar vein, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology organizes &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebird.org/content/ebird/&quot;&gt;eBird&lt;/a&gt;, a year-round, volunteer-driven data collection method to track birds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070900216X&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; (cited almost 300 times!) the authors describe their commitment to good user-rewards for eBird participants. Although the people collecting data are doing so to help the researchers, the data collection process needs to feel fulfilling to them in order to motivate them to collect and input data. The researchers observed that their data submissions went up when they instituted more user-rewards, including data visualizations on the site that allow the citizen scientists to see their data in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pretty stark contrast, the EPA has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/air-research/air-sensor-toolbox-citizen-scientists-resources&quot;&gt;toolbox&lt;/a&gt; for citizen scientists who are interested in gathering their own air quality data. However, it&amp;#39;s not clear if the process involves feeding the data back to the EPA for use, so it is just for the user&amp;#39;s own edification. I&amp;#39;m not sure there&amp;#39;s enough incentive there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Data quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00035.x/abstract&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/MunCarFin2010&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Data density&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Of course, if you are going to have many people collecting cheap data for scientific purposes, you have to worry about data quality. On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/NSSDeviations&quot;&gt;NSSD podcast&lt;/a&gt;, that was one of the main things Roger and Hilary discussed about the Plume project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, this is an open problem, but I&amp;#39;ve seen some interesting work on data augmentation that looks promising. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00035.x/abstract&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; found that they could scale models created with eBird data to get very similar predictions to those produced by models trained on high quality standardized data. Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://misrc.csom.umn.edu/workshops/2012/fall/Ipeirotis.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about data produced by Mechanical Turk workers suggests the use of the EM algorithm to produce probabilistic labels that have more reliable quality. Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf&quot;&gt;awesome paper&lt;/a&gt; (by Andrew Gelman, among others) does election forecasting using non-representative polls taken on the Xbox using multilevel regression and poststratification.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&amp;#39;m really excited about the possibility of more inexpensive sensor data to change the world! Certainly using tools like the Fitbit has changed my life, and I think there are things that could be done with the data (perhaps necessitating some more statistical research) that could benefit us all. As much as I love the idea of data-collecting pigeons, I want to be completely involved with the data collection process and getting something back from it myself. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Contextual notes</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Because I tend to select books by how thick they are (super-fast-reader problems) and I am a glutton for punishment, I have been slowly working my way through two of David Foster Wallace&amp;#39;s books concurrently. I am reading a paper copy of Infinite Jest, but the Kindle edition of The Pale King. These contrasting experiences got me thinking about contextual notes, particularly in electronic media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Infinite Jest, I have two bookmarks, one for my place in the main text and one for my place in the endnotes. In fact, I sometimes have to employ a third bookmark because many of the endnotes have their own footnotes, which can run on for pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Kindle edition of The Pale King lets me click on a hyperlink to the endnote, and if there is a footnote in the endnote I can click that link, and on and on. Once I have reached the end of the rabbit hole, I can use the back button to step my way out of the layers and eventually find my way back to the text, just where I left off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for an electronic edition, where I couldn&amp;#39;t keep my thumb in the back of the book, being able to travel through the footnotes in this way has been invaluable. But, the paired experiences made me think more about how context is provided in electronic mediums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1mm9303x&quot;&gt;my dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote in an offhand way that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interactive articles on the web can be updated depending 
on parameter manipulations, and some news outlets have 
begun including contextual information in their articles. 
Rather than hyperlinks taking the user away from the page 
they were reading,  New York Magazine includes ephemeral popovers, 
and Medium has instituted in-context comments linked to a 
particular paragraph or sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this quote, I was trying to refer to the sorts of contextual information that can be access unobtrusively if a reader wants to see it, or ignored if they don&amp;#39;t. Of course, I didn&amp;#39;t include a citation, and when I went back looking for these features, I found it hard to track them down. In fact, at one point my googling returned my own dissertation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve now discovered that while Medium has retained in-context comments they have changed the default for these notes to be private. This really reduces the usefulness of the feature, and I was baffled when I went back to look for it. Finally, I saw a tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/memotv&quot;&gt;Memo Akten&lt;/a&gt; confirming that they used to have such a feature, but recently removed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I guess y&amp;#39;all didn&amp;#39;t notice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Medium&quot;&gt;@medium&lt;/a&gt; made side-notes private? Little notes to clarify, provide insight now not visible to public. how lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Memo Akten (@memotv) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/memotv/status/662253919708520448&quot;&gt;November 5, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more about the original functionality, see this 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ev/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2&quot;&gt;post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the author (and CEO of Medium?!) writes that the notes can be used &amp;quot;as footnotes.&amp;quot; However, with the defaults changed, that&amp;#39;s not true until the original author goes back and changes the settings one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xululululuuum&quot;&gt;@xululululuuum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Medium&quot;&gt;@Medium&lt;/a&gt; no! I have to delete all my current &amp;#39;side notes&amp;#39; and recreate them as &amp;#39;comments&amp;#39;! No automatic way of doing it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bad?src=hash&quot;&gt;#bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Memo Akten (@memotv) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/memotv/status/662265035289436160&quot;&gt;November 5, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memo and I aren&amp;#39;t the only ones noticing this. Once I found the original blog post, I noticed that most of the comments were actually from the past month and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@owenblacker/marginal-notes-on-medium-268b3f727e6d#.4v2lc1xsm&quot;&gt;bemoaning the feature change&lt;/a&gt;. I was happy to see some references to other places where this is done well, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/&quot;&gt;Tufte CSS&lt;/a&gt; which implements Tufte-style sidenotes in an HTML environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Magazine feature seems to have survived, although I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find whatever article I was reading when I wrote about the popovers in my dissertation. I did track down this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/11/its-small-touches-that-can-make-a-difference-in-new-yorks-layouts/&quot;&gt;Niemen Lab piece&lt;/a&gt; which talks about an &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/jon-stewart-rosewater-in-conversation.html&quot;&gt;interview with Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; that uses the feature. Again, I don&amp;#39;t know what article it was that caught my eye while I was writing, and it was hard to locate a more recent piece with the feature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another place I have seen side notes used well is in Bret Victor&amp;#39;s explorable essays, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming&quot;&gt;Learnable Programming&lt;/a&gt;. Leaving aside the fact that these essays are &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; interactive, they do a nice job of balancing the information given to you in the stream of the narrative, and what is included in a Tufte-style side note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bret is really a font of knowledge, as you can see when you look at (for example) the contextual notes he provides alongside presentation slides on his website. If you want to watch him talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/#!/TheFutureOfProgramming&quot;&gt;the future of programming&lt;/a&gt; you can do that, but if you want to dig deeper you can look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/#!/dbx&quot;&gt;slides and side notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started writing about this, I did some reading about David Foster Wallace and electronic endnotes, and came across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/&quot;&gt;beautifully designed piece&lt;/a&gt; on The Atlantic. In the intro to the article, they note that when it was published in print they did a sort of static popover design, but they recently took the opportunity to redo the article with nested electronic endnotes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/DFWatlantic.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;DFW atlantic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, if it feels so satisfying to be able to dig deeper into information if we need it, or gloss over the parts we don&amp;#39;t, why isn&amp;#39;t this type of feature more common? And what other features could be included in electronic media to give us more of the same sort of experience?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>20th New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting (NEISM) </title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I am at Smith, I am technically an &amp;quot;isolated&amp;quot; statistician. It&amp;#39;s a funny term, because I don&amp;#39;t feel isolated. I have great colleagues in the Statistical and Data Sciences program (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Ebbaumer/&quot;&gt;Ben Baumer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Ejcrouser/&quot;&gt;Jordan Crouser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.smith.edu/faculty_halvorsen.php&quot;&gt;Katherine Halverson&lt;/a&gt;), although I am the only person with a PhD in statistics. However, there is a great mailing list for isostats and a few local meetings, so I am happy to accept the designation if it means I get to participate in these great discussions, many of which are teaching-oriented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I got to go to my first NEISM (New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting). It was great fun, and as always I got more out of the experience by livetweeting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about many current issues that statisticians are facing, including the importance of p-values, technology in statistics, and what skills were necessary in the context of big data (surprisingly, that conversation turned to communication, not databases). We also talked about issues more specific to teaching the introductory statistics class, including  the GAISE report, which promotes multivariate analysis but doesn&amp;#39;t take a particular stand on technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple discussions got a bit heated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, we spent some time debating the importance of tables (e.g. the standard normal table) in teaching. 
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What about tables? There&amp;#39;s a range of responses- 3 days on tables, only technology, or something in between. I&amp;#39;m in between. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655399941356015616&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some folks in the room were insistent that tables not be used, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudeboybert&quot;&gt;@rudeboybert&lt;/a&gt; and I were both on the side of showing the tables in conjunction with technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you are looking for a good way to integrate technology when teaching about normal distributions, the mosaic package functions xpnorm and xqnorm are fantastic. That&amp;#39;s where the preview image on the blog came from.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The question of whether or not to abandon normal tables in intro stats led to vigorous debate &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEISM20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#NEISM20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Albert Y. Kim (@rudeboybert) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/655408933218164736&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez&quot;&gt;@StatsbyLopez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudeboybert&quot;&gt;@rudeboybert&lt;/a&gt; Not taking a hard line. De-emphasize tables but don&amp;#39;t ban them.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655411316799225856&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time collating conferences we liked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We love the &amp;#39;COTS. USCOTS, ECOTS, ICOTS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655464971355164672&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and journals,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Popular journals include &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/signmagazine&quot;&gt;@signmagazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JStatEd&quot;&gt;@JStatEd&lt;/a&gt;, Chance, TISE. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655469407037169666&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed the importance of communication in statistics and &amp;quot;data science.&amp;quot; I mentioned the SDS program at Smith, and folks on twitter jumped in to tout the benefits of communication.
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smithcollege&quot;&gt;@smithcollege&lt;/a&gt; I was in a program called Integrated Science and Technology that required frequent teamwork and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Data Science Renee (@BecomingDataSci) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/655416278388224000&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; I think this is so important. Students SBAT communicate results clearly to anyone, inc those without statistical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amy Hogan (@alittlestats) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alittlestats/status/655415627474145281&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of the isolated statisticians teach at small colleges, we also thought about the challenges of incorporating communication in large classes, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/03/26/an-instructors-thoughts-on-peer-review-for-data-analysis-in-coursera/&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed assignments in the JHU data science specializationn&lt;/a&gt; were mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What to do about communication when you have hundreds of students? Maybe peer-review is the answer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655411931549954048&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another discussion that got heated, particularly on twitter, was the question of group work. We had come around to the idea that group projects were probably the best way to include communication in classes. It lets students do real analysis and present the results. Grading a few team projects is more manageable for the instructor than reading many individual papers. But, we acknowledged that there is no optimal way to select groups. One participant asked, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;HOW do you make groups work in classes? Assigning alphabetically doesn&amp;#39;t work, nor by seating, nor students choosing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655422919175241729&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many suggestions, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; I ended up doing most the work no matter who I got in group. Maybe assign based on % of work done on previous. High %ers together?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BlinkPop (@emilyeifler) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilyeifler/status/655424481775607809&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; i randomize from the class list, re-do weekly. really like the results from doing so. everyone encouraged to get to know everyone&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dianne Cook (@visnut) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/visnut/status/656053091490394112&quot;&gt;October 19, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; idea: students choose partner, then pairs randomly grouped? Benefit of comfortable w someone on team plus forced to work w new ppl&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Data Science Renee (@BecomingDataSci) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/655457852044242944&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hadleywickham&quot;&gt;Hadley Wickham&lt;/a&gt; immediately piped up with a link to a paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/CLStrategies(JCCCT).pdf&quot;&gt;Effective Strategies for Cooperative Learning&lt;/a&gt;, which includes many of the strategies we discussed both in person and electronically. The executive summary of the paper is that you have to assign groups, you might want to think about outnumbered minorities, particularly at the beginning of a class, and you should take into account peoples&amp;#39; schedules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also discusses the importance of peer ratings to assess participation, and there was a suggestion in the meeting to do this rating as part of the final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When evaluating groups, ask them to rate group participation (inc. themselves) &amp;amp; answer simple Qs about their analysis on the final &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/neism20?src=hash&quot;&gt;#neism20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655425776188334080&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this, you are able to weed out people who really did not participate. If they can&amp;#39;t list their explanatory and response variables without referring to notes or teammates, they didn&amp;#39;t participate fully in the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was some pushback on twitter about whether forcing students to work in groups is the right answer. As the paper says, &amp;quot;As we tell our students, we’re sorry if they’re unhappy about having to work in teams but the truth is that our job is not to make them happy— it is to prepare them to be professionals.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCombinator&quot;&gt;@KCombinator&lt;/a&gt; disagreed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; why is your assumption that group work is crucial? Why not just let loners work alone if they wish? I do it for life.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lambda Kansas City (@KCombinator) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCombinator/status/655425972452225024&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recommended a few resources by [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; read &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulg&quot;&gt;@paulg&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/gwS2CvZT2O&quot;&gt;http://t.co/gwS2CvZT2O&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/1faV6YPcl8&quot;&gt;http://t.co/1faV6YPcl8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/WY88ZX1HS5&quot;&gt;http://t.co/WY88ZX1HS5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/yBzlwgwCys&quot;&gt;http://t.co/yBzlwgwCys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lambda Kansas City (@KCombinator) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCombinator/status/655446265199656960&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question was,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCombinator&quot;&gt;@KCombinator&lt;/a&gt; this is getting pretty philosophical! Are there enough jobs for everyone who would prefer not to work with others to have them?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/655445642668605440&quot;&gt;October 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Fitbit colors</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a devoted Fitbit user for over a year now, and I think that as a device it is the sort of thing that a statistician would natually enjoy. It produces rich data about my day-to-day life, can be used to identify notable dates in my year, and does a great job of making me more physically active &amp;quot;on the margin.&amp;quot; But, the Fitbit app designers have made very strange color choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d appreciate any insight you have about why they might have chosen these colors. Here&amp;#39;s the daily trajectory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get up and start moving, the graphs show your steps in an aqua blue that is very similar to the Fitbit dashboard color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Fitbit1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;At the beginning of the day&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as you continue, the colors move from aqua, to yellow, to orange/red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Fitbit2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A little later&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Fitbit3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting close to the step goal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you hit your step goal the color switches to green,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/Fitbit4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Goal reached&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This color progression drives me a little crazy. It&amp;#39;s not in rainbow order, and it seems like it should move from red to orange, to yellow, to green/blue. In other words, the colors should indicate something about your health level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another choice I can imagine for the colors would be to code the progression I mentioned above to the progress you&amp;#39;ve made over the day. The Fitbit knows how long your typical day is, and it knows when you woke up. Maybe it could show green if you were making good progress to your goal for the day (given the time of day it was), yellow if you weren&amp;#39;t, and red if you were really behind. Then, once you hit the goal it could switch to a different color (e.g. purple) to indicate you&amp;#39;d hit it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas about the color trajectory they&amp;#39;ve chosen? Do other fitness trackers use similar colors?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fabric posters</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t you hate having to take a poster to conferences? The tube is bulky, it&amp;#39;s easy to forget in the airport (or on the plane!), sometimes you get charged extra for your &amp;quot;additional carry-on&amp;quot; and often the poster doesn&amp;#39;t look great once it arrives. Plus, it&amp;#39;s expensive to print a poster, and you usually only get one use out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, the fabric poster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I learned about this wonderful option via twitter, before the Women in Statistics Conference. I was one of three women to bring fabric posters. Shown here are the other two, demonstrating one of the fantastic things about fabric posters-- they&amp;#39;re flexible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superhero statisticians to the rescue! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kralljr&quot;&gt;@kralljr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HelenPowell01&quot;&gt;@HelenPowell01&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WiS2014?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WiS2014&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/uuVl05d40z&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uuVl05d40z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stephanie Hicks (@stephaniehicks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks/status/467447722703060994&quot;&gt;May 16, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better than that, you can fold them up in your suitcase and they don&amp;#39;t wrinkle (or if they do, you can iron them!). Plus, they have the same DPI as paper, they&amp;#39;re cheaper, and you can easily re-use them (either as a poster or as a superhero cape). Still not sold? Check out these photos from IEEE Vis in Paris. The conference organizers needed to take down the posters quickly, and almost anyone with a paper poster ended up with something ripped, wrinkled, and taped to someone else&amp;#39;s poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN&quot;&gt;@AmeliaMN&lt;/a&gt; Sad paper posters, happy (folded) fabric poster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ieeevis?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ieeevis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/VFZj2HdOuH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VFZj2HdOuH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/533186832344055809&quot;&gt;November 14, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so how do you do it? &lt;a href=&quot;http://ascb.org/how-to-print-a-fabric-poster/&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic, and it&amp;#39;s where I learned how to print a fabric poster. For whatever reason, that link keeps changing, so I&amp;#39;ll summarize the main points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the website &lt;a href=&quot;www.spoonflower.com&quot;&gt;spoonflower.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose the &amp;quot;performance knit&amp;quot; fabric, which should cost around $25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload your poster &lt;strong&gt;as a png&lt;/strong&gt; (ignore at your peril!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure it looks right, and order!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Printing and shipping is variable, but Spoonflower has a data-driven page that will tell you &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.spoonflower.com/customer/portal/articles/1173283-how-long-will-it-take-to-get-my-order-&quot;&gt;how many days production is currently taking&lt;/a&gt;. If you need your poster quickly, you can pay for rush shipping, but either way the poster will come folded up in one of those soft plastic envelopes that fits easily into any mailbox. What are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New tools for data analysis and journalism</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;http://symposium2014.computation-and-journalism.com/&quot;&gt;Computation + Journalism Symposium&lt;/a&gt; continues to be filled with fascinating inlets to journalistic projects and innovative computational approaches (like using drones to map garbage dumps) the component that always catches my attention is the demoing of new tools for data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#39;s symposium was hosted at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brown.columbia.edu/&quot;&gt;Brown Institute&lt;/a&gt; and was no exception-- I saw many projects that approached elements of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/FOSP.html&quot;&gt;theory about the future of statistical programming&lt;/a&gt; from different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the data analysis projects were discussed on a panel about journalistic platforms. The panelists were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/gideonmann/&quot;&gt;Gideon Mann&lt;/a&gt;, of Bloomberg, speaking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://colaboratory.jupyter.org/welcome/&quot;&gt;coLaboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kareemamin.com/&quot;&gt;Kareem Amin&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://newscorp.com/&quot;&gt;NewsCorp&lt;/a&gt;, talking about a forthcoming tool that uses custom HTML tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brianabelson.com/&quot;&gt;Brian Abelson&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://enigma.io/&quot;&gt;enigma.io&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://towcenter.org/&quot;&gt;Tow Center&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/&quot;&gt;streamtools&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytlabs.com/&quot;&gt;NYT R&amp;amp;D labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the tools spoke to the ideas I am engaging with in my dissertation, which I found very encouraging. The context that I have been thinking most deeply about is the high school data science classroom, much like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/mobilize.html&quot;&gt;Mobilize&lt;/a&gt; project, which I formerly worked on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, data journalism is the other context that I had been hoping to find relevance in. The fact that the panelists were engaging with the same issues, of being able to get started quickly but develop new modules as needed, of publishability and the need for interactivity, suggests that the two seemingly-different contexts (high school students/teachers, and data journalists) might not be that different in their needs after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;coLaboratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had asked my twitterverse about coLaboratory in September,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saw this article on CoLaboratory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/MylVNfZckI&quot;&gt;http://t.co/MylVNfZckI&lt;/a&gt; but would love to hear from people who use it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hmason&quot;&gt;@hmason&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/status/515557079642169344&quot;&gt;September 26, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but got no response except for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hmason&quot;&gt;Hilary Mason&lt;/a&gt; responding that she didn&amp;#39;t know the project and didn&amp;#39;t know why her photo was used on the article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it was great to hear about the project straight from the horse&amp;#39;s mouth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colaboratory.jupyter.org/welcome/&quot;&gt;coLaboratory&lt;/a&gt; seems to be part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;project Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;, and it offers an iPython notebook that allows you to collaborate with others. Sadly, all their documentation seems to be technical, without any of the &amp;quot;so what&amp;quot; that I look for when learning about a tool. I did find a google research &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/08/doing-data-science-with-colaboratory.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which gives a little more context and a few examples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, coLaboratory can produce interactive reports (meaning, with sliders and buttons for users to interact with). It also has some focus on making it easy to develop the interface, using simple commands to invoke interactive controls. However, once a user modifies a control they need to re-click on the &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; button to see the updated information. This is my main complaint with iPython notebooks in general, so it&amp;#39;s too bad that the version for creating interactive documents doesn&amp;#39;t manage to jump that hurdle.  The other problem is that the source code really isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; readable when you get down to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thelma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool that Amin was talking about had different advantages. First, it is a click-driven interface, so you click on data inputs and outputs and see the results in the browser. By allowing users to build analysis in this way, you make it easier for novices to get started easily while still making nice results. The product he was talking about is based on custom HTML tags, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polymer-project.org/&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt; web components. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that Amin wanted the name of the project to be made public yet, but he showed a demo and several people tweeted out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelmanews.github.io/thelma-component-demo/data-demo.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you do data analysis it updates the webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/isWky1uNAV&quot;&gt;http://t.co/isWky1uNAV&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kareemamin&quot;&gt;@kareemamin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cj2014?src=hash&quot;&gt;#cj2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nick Diakopoulos (@ndiakopoulos) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ndiakopoulos/status/525677010816090112&quot;&gt;October 24, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it appears to be called Thelma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Thelma needs a lot more work before it&amp;#39;s really made public. It&amp;#39;s not clear how to begin if you want to do something that doesn&amp;#39;t use the data and chart types already on the demo page, and even those aren&amp;#39;t exactly transparent. But, there&amp;#39;s a lot of potential here. The resulting charts are somewhat interactive, and updating happens as soon as you modify the inputs/outputs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;streamtools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brianabelson.com/&quot;&gt;Brian Abelson&lt;/a&gt; spoke about &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/&quot;&gt;streamtools&lt;/a&gt;. Abelson was not involved with the development of streamtools, but he found it useful enough that he was willing to be its advocate on the panel. streamtools is a dataflow programming environment for working with live streaming data. Rather than waiting for data to be presented as a flat file, the lab wanted to allow users to deal directly with data as it streams in. Since I work with the Communications Design Group, it immediately made me think of Dan Ingalls&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrik_(software)&quot;&gt;fabrik&lt;/a&gt; (a visual programming environment in which users &amp;quot;wired&amp;quot; components together), but of course there is a rich history of this sort of blocks programming environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool does a great job of making explicit the links between components in the system, and giving a visual hint to the data flowing through the system. However, it seems that the intended user of the system is someone who knows quite a bit about data analysis and programming. The blocks do not cue you toward their behavior, and the &amp;quot;parts bin&amp;quot; (to steal a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lively-web.org/welcome.html&quot;&gt;Lively&lt;/a&gt; term) is full of consise but not extremely descriptive labels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IEEE programming language rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other project (not from the panel) that caught my eye was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/&quot;&gt;Nick Diakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; interactive &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-10-programming-languages&quot;&gt;ranking of programming languages&lt;/a&gt; for IEEE Spectrum. Sadly, it seems like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages&quot;&gt;interactive version&lt;/a&gt; is behind a paywall, but it&amp;#39;s worth the 99¢ to see it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranking is based on a number of factors, such as position in google results, number of github repositories, and questions on stackoverflow. The interactive tool lets you see four different versions of the rating: IEEE Spectrum, Trending, Jobs, and Open. You can also filter the languages shown to only display Mobile, Web, Enterprise, or Embedded languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real beauty in this project is that you can manipulate the parameters used in the rankings to create your own version. If you don&amp;#39;t believe that google page rank is a good measure of a programming language&amp;#39;s ubiquity, you can drag that slider down or even zero it out. This lets you modify the procedure used to create the ranking, and it allows you to perform ad hoc sensitivity analysis. Many changes to parameters do not change the rankings, which could make a reader more confident in the ranking as provided by the IEEE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the list is so robust to parameter manipulation that it was hard for me to tell if the ranking was being updated dynamically, or if you need to click the &amp;quot;Save as Custom&amp;quot; button to see the results! However, they do provide a great &amp;quot;Make a Comparison&amp;quot; button, which shows a sort of slopegraph/bumps chart (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk&quot;&gt;Tufte&lt;/a&gt;) displaying which languages were displaced and to where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article/interactive can&amp;#39;t really be described as a &amp;quot;tool,&amp;quot; per se, but I loved seeing an example of analysis where the underlying data work was exposed. This is the sort of &amp;quot;interaction all the way down&amp;quot; that I think is the future of data analysis. Not only should creators of data products be able to interact with their work as they produce it, consumers of those products should have the opportunity to deeply critique the process by viewing a transparent representation of the analysis process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so invigorated by everything that I saw at the symposium. It&amp;#39;s such a treat to be around people who are thinking about some of the same issues that I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about any of these projects, they are almost all forkable on github, which is another one of the principles that I think all good software should adhere to! What other interesting projects have you seen recently?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kid Pix</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la&quot;&gt;datascience.la&lt;/a&gt; meetups are held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crosscamp.us/&quot;&gt;Cross Campus&lt;/a&gt;, I joined their newletter, and I&amp;#39;m so glad I did-- it leads me to all sorts of cool things! One such event was a talk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://red-green-blue.com/about/&quot;&gt;Craig Hickman&lt;/a&gt; about the history and success of &lt;a href=&quot;http://red-green-blue.com/kid-pix-the-early-years/&quot;&gt;Kid Pix&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren&amp;#39;t a child in the &amp;#39;90s, Kid Pix was a fabulously open-ended paint program designed for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was a great mix of nostalgia and inspiration for me. I loved hearing about the principles that guided Hickman as he worked, like the idea of contextual menus, so kids never had to look in the menu bar. I was also brought back to my childhood, creating artwork, menus for pretend restaurants, birthday cards, notes, and much more, all in Kid Pix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hickman referenced two papers that inspired him-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-12/1983_12_BYTE_08-12_Easy_Software#page/n143/mode/2up&quot;&gt;Walt Disney and User Oriented Software&lt;/a&gt; and Alan Kay&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://frameworker.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/alan-kay-computer-software-sciam-sept-84.pdf&quot;&gt;Computer Software&lt;/a&gt;. Since I work with Alan, I&amp;#39;ve read Computer Software several times, and love the ideas about software being flexible enough to do things that the designer didn&amp;#39;t foresee, and the importance of computer users &amp;quot;creating&amp;quot; rather than just &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; (something that comes up a lot in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/%7Eamcnamara/Mobilize.html&quot;&gt;Mobilize project&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I hadn&amp;#39;t seen the article on Disney before. When I read it, I was surprised to discover I had heard most of the anecdotes before from people in Alan&amp;#39;s group. The article is full of connections between the principles of Disney animators and how they could be applied by software developers. For example, &amp;quot;prepare the audience.&amp;quot; A Disney character will show you what it&amp;#39;s going to do before it begins the action-- for example, by bending its knees before a jump. Software should do the same. The author suggests that a slow in/slow out approach to changing things on the screen can help a user be prepared for what is happening, and not get lost in a transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kid Pix accomplished a lot of the goals outlined in these two papers. You could see the tools available to you on the left hand side, and you always knew to expect relevant contextual options to appear at the bottom of the screen. Everything was modifiable, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare&quot;&gt;Susan Kare&lt;/a&gt;-designed font stamps. Hickman explained that he&amp;#39;d loved the hieroglyphic-style font &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kare.com/portfolio/05_apple_fonts.html&quot;&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, designed by Kare for the original Macintosh, so he just &amp;quot;put it back&amp;quot; as the stamps you could use in Kid Pix. As a child, I loved the fact that the stamps were modifiable, and I think the goal of a program that is manipulable all the way down is wonderful for any age level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the unique qualities of Kid Pix, compared to a more standard paint program, is that the process matters as much or more than the final product. Although this had been my experience as a kid, I hadn&amp;#39;t realized that it was explicitly intended to be that way. Listen to Hickman explain,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F170212262&amp;show_artwork=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original version of Kid Pix was black and white, but Hickman soon created a second version with the software company Broderbund, which was in color and included sounds. This is the version I have the strongest memories of, although I think we had the black-and-white version first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by David Pogue&amp;#39;s review of commercial version, which Hickman showed us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid Pix 1.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: Brilliant; hilarious; innovative; inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: None. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that gives you something to aspire to, doesn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever used Kid Pix, its sounds will immediately bring you back. Here is Hickman demoing some of the tools, including the popular eraser bomb tool that cleared the entire screen:
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F170212261&amp;show_artwork=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try out the original (black and white) Kid Pix, James Friend has created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/&quot;&gt;Mac emulator&lt;/a&gt; that runs it. For Hickman&amp;#39;s complete talk, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqVhK6JgbSU&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from Media Leaders or &lt;a href=&quot;http://red-green-blue.com/kid-pix-the-early-years/&quot;&gt;Hickman&amp;#39;s page on Kid Pix&lt;/a&gt;, which goes through a lot of the material from his talk. Thanks again to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crosscamp.us/&quot;&gt;Cross Campus&lt;/a&gt; for hosting such a great event! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Data Science LA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now involved in the recently-launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la&quot;&gt;datascience.la&lt;/a&gt; blog. While you&amp;#39;ll probably be drawn to the site for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/sessions/&quot;&gt;useR! conference session videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/category/user-conference/interviews/&quot;&gt;interviews with data scientists&lt;/a&gt;, and meetup announcements, there&amp;#39;s going to be much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;thumb&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/img/datascienceLA.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;DataScienceLA&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/data-science-goes-to-college-with-datafest/&quot;&gt;Data Science Goes to College with DataFest&lt;/a&gt;, yet another summary of the yearly DataFest we hold at UCLA and that&amp;#39;s going national. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/statistics-grad-school-what-is-it-really-like/&quot;&gt;Statistics Grad School-- What is it Really Like?&lt;/a&gt; describing some of the experience of getting a PhD in statistics at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;ll be giving a talk at this month&amp;#39;s DataVis LA meetup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/datavis-la-meetup-eyeo-festival-highlights-august-26/&quot;&gt;Eyeo Festival Highlights&lt;/a&gt; on August 26th. Come by Cornerstone OnDemand to hear me talk about the things that inspired me the most from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eyeofestival.com/&quot;&gt;eyeo festival&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la&quot;&gt;datascience.la&lt;/a&gt;, you can follow along via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wwwDSLA&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/DataScienceLA&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, add us to your favorite &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la/feed&quot;&gt;rss&lt;/a&gt; reader, or just drop by &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.la&quot;&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m excited to be a part of it!&lt;/p&gt;
