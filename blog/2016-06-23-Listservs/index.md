For the most part, I get my data news from the web (blogs like [flowingdata](http://flowingdata.com/), [simply statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/), [stats chat](http://www.statschat.org.nz/)) and twitter (check out the [people I follow](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN/following)). However, there are a few email mailing lists I've joined that are worth the addional lines in my inbox. Here they are:


- [Data Is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://twitter.com/jsvine). A great source of open, interesting data sets. 
- [Above Chart](https://tinyletter.com/abovechart) by [Scott Klein](https://www.propublica.org/site/author/scott_klein). Historical data visualizations from newspapers. 
- [O'Reilly Data Newsletter](http://www.oreilly.com/data/newsletter.html). News about data (often skews toward computer science).
