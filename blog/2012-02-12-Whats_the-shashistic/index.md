One of the major perks of becoming a statistician is hearing people (mainly drunk) who mispronounce the name of my field, earnestly repeating it over and over again in the hopes that I will tell them about "shashtistics," or recite "the shashtistic" on them (generally, probability 1 that they are wasted).
