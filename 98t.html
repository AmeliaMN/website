  <h1>Stat 98T, Data Visualization</h1>
<p class="lead">In Spring 2015, I will be teaching a general education seminar on data visualization at UCLA.</p>
<h4>Collegium of University Teaching Fellows (CUTF)</h4>
This class is made possible by my appointment to the UCLA CUTF for the 2014-2015 school year. In the Fall quarter, I am taking a seminar led by <a href="http://www.oid.ucla.edu/about/people/haas">Kumiko Haas</a> of the <a href="http://www.oid.ucla.edu/">Office of Instructional Development</a>. The goal of the seminar is to help the fellows to develop their university-level syllabi and work on pedagogical techniques. Fellows come from a wide variety of disciplines across the campus, so there is opportunity for cross-disciplinary learning.</p>

		<h4>Syllabus</h4>
<p>The course syllabus is still under development as I am taking the CUTF seminar, but a first draft of the syllabus is available <a href="DataVisSyllabus.pdf">here</a>. Comments and suggestions are welcome! The readings listed on the syllabus will be bound into a course reader, available for purchase at the UCLA bookstore during the term the course is held.</p>
<h4>Readings</h4>
<p>Readings include selections from Nathan Yau's books <a href="http://book.flowingdata.com/">Visualize This</a> and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111846219X.html">Data Points</a>, William Cleveland's <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Graphing-Data-William-Cleveland/dp/0963488414?sa-no-redirect=1">The Elements of Graphing Data</a>, and Leland Wilkinson's <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448?sa-no-redirect=1">The Grammar of Graphics</a>. </p>
<h4> Course Structure </h4>
<p>During the course, we will read these texts and use them to critique data visualizations we find "in the wild," including in newspapers, magazines, and scientific journals. The course will be open to any student at UCLA (no prerequisities), so I'm hoping to have rich discussions about what makes a data graphic "good" or "bad" and how to trust what we read in visualizations. </p>
