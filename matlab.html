		<p class="lead">Matlab is where I got my start in programming, so it will always hold a spot in my heart. It's great for numerical simulations, 
		but now that I'm an <a href="R.html">R</a> acolyte it's unlikely I'll go back to a piece of proprietary software.</p>
		<h2>Pattern modeling</h2>
		<p>As an undergraduate math major, I worked for several years on a differential equations project for my senior capstone. 
		Some of that work has made its way into a paper called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4417">Instabilities and Patterns in Coupled Reaction-Diffusion Layers</a>, with my co-authors Anne Catll&aacute; 
		and <a href="http://chadtopaz.com">Chad Topaz</a> (Chad was also my advisor for my senior capstone). 
		Apart from the math (differential equations and algebraic manipulation, basically), I wrote a Matlab program to simulate the problem we were studying, and produced 
		both still images (like those seen in the paper) and movies showing the system over time.
