			<h1>Mobilize</h1>
				<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.mobilizingcs.org">Mobilize</a> aims to bring computational thinking to high school math and science classrooms through 
				participatory data collection (using a <a href="http://ohmage.org/">smartphone app</a> that allows students 
				to customize surveys to collect data on an issue that interests them) 
				and the subsequent data analysis. </p>
				<p>A lot of my teaching experience is from leading professional development sessions for in-service teachers. 
				As a graduate student researcher on the Mobilize project I teach high school teachers from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) who are participants 
				in the project.</p>

					<h2>Mobilize R package</h2>
					<p>After trying several computational tools for the Mobilize activities, we have decided to move forward with R and <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>. 
					Although most of the basic tasks we ask students and teachers to complete are easy to do in R, some of them would require more coding expertise than the students have. 
					In the interest of retaining engaging activities without complex code, I wrote an R package, <a href="https://github.com/AmeliaMN/MobilizeSimple"><code>MobilizeSimple</code></a>, which packages tasks like mapmaking 
					and text analysis into simpler functions. </p>

					<h2>R and RStudio documentation</h2>
					<p>Recently I've been working a lot on documentation for R and RStudio. One major place this can be found is the <a href="https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/rstudio">Mobilize wiki</a>. 
					The wiki has content on almost everything Mobilize-related, but I can take credit for the R and RStudio documentation.</p>
					<p>Then, because some students and teachers are more visual learners, I've produced a series of introductory videos, which are hosted on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mobilizesupport">Mobilize YouTube</a>. 
					Again, I can only take credit for the R and RStudio videos.</p>

				<h2>Professional development</h2>
				<p>Many of the teachers in our program are initially unfamiliar with exploratory 
				data analysis, so the professional development sessions 
				I teach encourage creative exploration and plot creation. "In-service" means current teachers, not those who are still in the process of becoming licensed. Because we work with 
				current high school teachers, our professional development sessions are typically a day or two (if they take place during the school year) or an intensive week (over the summer).
				</p><p>Below are some examples of motivating presentations I use to introduce the ideas in these sessions.</p>

			<p><b>Permuted graphics</b></p>
			<p>During the summer of 2012, we also explored some of the ideas of <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/">Heike Hofmann</a>, trying to learn to "calibrate" our eyes to recognize true patterns in data, 
			as opposed to patterns which might have appeared due to chance. The activity was so popular that we've repeated it many times with teachers and students.</p>
