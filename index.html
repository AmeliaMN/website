	<h1>Amelia McNamara</h1>
		<p class="lead">Statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California-Los Angeles. </p>
		<p>My advisor is <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau">Mark Hansen</a>, and I work with with the Communications Design Group (CDG) at <a href="http://www.vpri.org/">Viewpoints Research Institute</a>, directed by <a href="http://www.vpri.org/html/people/founders.htm">Alan Kay</a> (another member of my dissertation committee). A full list of my committee members and working abstract of my dissertation is available <a href="dissertation.html">here</a>.</p>

		<p>My work is focused on creating better tools for novices to use for data analysis. I am developing a <a href="FoSP.html">theory</a> about what the future of statistical programming should look like, and trying to determine the next steps on the way to those tools. Towards that vision, I am working with <a href="http://www.vpri.org/html/team_bios/aran_lunzer.htm">Aran Lunzer</a> at CDG to create an integration between R and <a href="http://lively-web.org/welcome.html">Lively Web</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests include statistics education, data visualization, and spatial statistics.</p>

				<p> My educational career has included elements typically associated with the right brain (design foundations, college English major) as well as the left brain (math was my other undergraduate major, and I am completing my PhD in statistics with a focus on computation).

				<p>However, I dislike the tendency to pigeonhole projects and people by the dichotomy of the right and left brain. Instead, I prefer to focus on projects that use a more holistic approach. In both my research and my teaching, I try to balance quantitative rigor with excellent communication.</p>

	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>For a more detailed look at my recent work, see my <a href="writings.html">writings</a>, <a href="presentations.html">presentations</a>, or look at some of my other <a href="portfolio.html">recent projects</a>. Or, look at my <a href="dissertation.html">dissertation committee members and dissertation abstract</a>, and read my <a href="FOSP.html">theory about the future of statistical programming</a>. </p>

	<h3>Teaching</h3>
		<p>For three years, I was a graduate student researcher on the <a href="http://www.mobilizingcs.org">Mobilize</a> project, which brings data science to high school students in the LA area, through participatory sensing and computational analysis in R and RStudio. My work with Mobilize is discussed <a href="Mobilize.html">here</a>, and has been a source of inspiration for my ongoing research into computational tools for novices.</p>

		<p>As a Teaching Fellow (TA), I taught discussion sections for three upper-division statistics classes at UCLA in the 2013-2014 school year (<a href="101a.html">101a</a>, <a href="102b.html">102b</a> and <a href="101c.html">101c</a>).</p>

		<p>Finally, I am currently developing a <a href="98t.html">data visualization course</a>, which I will be teaching as the instructor of record at UCLA in Spring 2015. I was given the opportunity to develop this course as part of the Collegium of University Teaching Fellows program at UCLA.</p>

		<h3>Curriculum vitae</h3>
