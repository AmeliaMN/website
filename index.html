	<h1>Amelia McNamara</h1>
		<p class="lead">Recent statistics PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles. </p>
		<p class="lead">Soon-to-be <a href="http://www.smith.edu/statistics/about.php">Statistical & Data Sciences</a> professor at Smith College.</p>
		<p>My work is focused on creating better tools for novices to use for data analysis. I am developing a <a href="FoSP.html">theory</a> about what the future of statistical programming should look like, and trying to determine the next steps on the way to those tools. For more, see <a href="dissertation.html">my dissertation</a>.</p>

		<p>My dissertation was officially co-advised by <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~rgould/Home/About_Me.html">Rob Gould</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/">Rick Schoenberg</a>, although I have worked closely with <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau">Mark Hansen</a> for many years. I also work with with the Communications Design Group (CDG), directed by <a href="http://www.vpri.org/html/people/founders.htm">Alan Kay</a> (another member of my dissertation committee). A full list of my committee members and abstract of my dissertation is available <a href="dissertation.html">here</a>. Towards my vision of statistical programming, I worked with <a href="http://www.vpri.org/html/team_bios/aran_lunzer.htm">Aran Lunzer</a> at CDG to create an integration between R and <a href="http://lively-web.org/welcome.html">Lively Web</a>.</p>

		<p>My research interests include statistics education, statistical computing, data visualization, and spatial statistics.</p>

				<p>Over the years, my educational career has included elements typically associated with the right brain (design foundations, college English major) as well as the left brain (math was my other undergraduate major, and I am completing my PhD in statistics with a focus on computation).

				<p>However, I dislike the tendency to pigeonhole projects and people by the dichotomy of the right and left brain. Instead, I prefer to focus on projects that use a more holistic approach. In both my research and my teaching, I try to balance quantitative rigor with excellent communication.</p>

	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>For a more detailed look at my recent work, see my <a href="writings.html">writings</a>, <a href="presentations.html">presentations</a>, or look at some of my other <a href="portfolio.html">recent projects</a>. Or, look at my <a href="dissertation.html">dissertation committee members and dissertation abstract</a>, and read my <a href="FOSP.html">theory about the future of statistical programming</a>. </p>

	<h3>Teaching</h3>
		<p>For three years, I was a graduate student researcher on the <a href="http://www.mobilizingcs.org">Mobilize</a> project, which brings data science to high school students in the LA area, through participatory sensing and computational analysis in R and RStudio. My work with Mobilize is discussed <a href="Mobilize.html">here</a>, and has been a source of inspiration for my ongoing research into computational tools for novices.</p>

		<p>As a Teaching Fellow (TA), I taught discussion sections for three upper-division statistics classes at UCLA in the 2013-2014 school year (<a href="101a.html">101a</a>, <a href="102b.html">102b</a> and <a href="101c.html">101c</a>).</p>

		<p>In the Spring 2015 quarter, I had the opportunity to develop and teach a <a href="98t.html">data visualization course</a>. I was given the opportunity to develop this course as part of the Collegium of University Teaching Fellows program at UCLA.</p>

		<h3>Curriculum vitae</h3>
