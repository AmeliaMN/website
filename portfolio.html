		  <p class="lead">All my work tries to balance left brain and right brain thinking. As such, I've focused on cultivating my analytical, statistical, and coding abilities alongside my artistic and design expertise. 
		  I especially love data visualization because it brings together these two types of thinking.</p>
		  <p class="lead">My portfolio is organized by coding language or artistic medium, and if you'd like to explore in that way, use the dropdown above. But for a higher level view, here are a few recent projects I'm especially proud of.</p>
