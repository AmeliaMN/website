I figured our first anniversary was as good a time as any to share this silly project I used data for, in the lead-up to our wedding. \n\nAs we were planning our wedding, I asked my husband if he wanted to do a first dance. I was expecting him to say 'no'-- he's an introvert who doesn't love the spotlight, and he has never really danced. To my surprise he said we definitely should do one, under one condition: that we take dance lessons in advance. Be still my heart! I grew up dancing (ballet, modern, hip hop, ballroom, etc) and love it so much. Doing dance lessons with my husband was a dream come true. Because I had more experience with dance, he let me pick the style we would learn and I wanted to do swing. \n\nWe worked with Cindy from [TC Swing](https://www.tcswing.com/), who was wonderful. During our first lesson, she showed us both Lindy Hop and East Coast Swing. She asked my husband which style felt more natural, and what our goals were for our dance. We settled on East Coast Swing because the basic step was easier to learn and we felt like we could learn more cool moves and feel more comfortable on the day. \n\nAs part of her wedding dance lesson package, Cindy also offers consultation on song choice and will do minor edits to get a track that works best for you! She had some suggested songs, but we wanted something that felt more like our musical style. \n\nJason and I have similar music taste-- after we started dating we discovered there were many times we had been at the same concerts before we met, and we're both big fans of [The Current](https://www.thecurrent.org/). (Fun fact: I had a mention of The Current in the first draft of my dissertation acknowledgements, but I cut it to save space. I still regret it!) The Current is a local public radio station that plays a huge variety of music, from oldies to local music to country to pop and on and on. From their website: \"The Current brings listeners the best authentic new music alongside the music that inspired it, from local to legendary, indie to influential, new to nostalgic.\" \n\nFor several weeks, both Jason and I worked on making lists of songs we might want for our first dance. My process was to think of songs I liked, and listen to The Current and write down anything that caught my ear. I think Jason's was similar. But, many of them weren't at the right tempo or time signature, or if they were, we'd realize the song was actually about something pretty dark. (We weren't looking to dance to a song about a breakup or drug overdose.) There are lists of swing-tempo songs online, but none of them really spoke to us. \n\nSo, I took to the data! I'm not sure how I stumbled on this dataset, maybe [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/), but I found out that a University of Minnesota librarian named Shane Nackerud had collected data on all the songs played on The Current from approximately 2005 to 2020. Local newspaper City Pages [did an article on the project at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804080731/http://www.citypages.com/music/what-songs-artists-has-the-current-played-most-since-2009-this-u-of-m-librarian-crunched-the-numbers/504392941) (though the City Pages is now defunct, so that's an Internet Archive link). And the data is still available [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OW7fosYNE6H41E0t7hhZSrxDTcMHtFta)!\n\nI played around with the data a bit, starting by looking at the mega-dataset Shane had put together of everything 2009-2018, \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTheCurrent <- read_csv(\"TheCurrent2009-2018.csv\")\nTheCurrent <- TheCurrent |>\n  mutate(date = ymd(date))\n\nsongcounts <- TheCurrent |>\n  count(Song, Artist)\n\ntop893 <- songcounts |>\n  arrange(desc(n)) |>\n  slice(1:893)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the Twin Cities, The Current broadcasts on 89.3 FM, so they often do \"top 893\" promotions, like the [top 893 albums](https://www.thecurrent.org/893albums), [893 essential songs of the 90s](https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2023/05/04/the-currents-893-essential-songs-of-the-90s) and [893 essential bands](https://www.thecurrent.org/song-countdown/893-essential-bands-8). All of these promos are based on popular votes from the community, not actually the most-played songs or bands. This is a cool way to do things (kind of the opposite of top 40!) but I thought I'd take a look at the data as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop893 |>\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Song                                                                             |Artist                                   |   n|\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|---:|\n|Communist Daughter - Not The Kid                                                 |Communist Daughter                       | 541|\n|Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros - Home                                      |Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros     | 533|\n|The National - Bloodbuzz Ohio                                                    |The National                             | 532|\n|The Lumineers - Ho Hey                                                           |The Lumineers                            | 526|\n|Foster The People - Pumped Up Kicks                                              |Foster The People                        | 501|\n|Of Monsters And Men - Little Talks                                               |Of Monsters And Men                      | 492|\n|The Heavy - How You Like Me Now?                                                 |The Heavy                                | 489|\n|Animal Collective - My Girls                                                     |Animal Collective                        | 488|\n|LCD Soundsystem - Dance Yrself Clean                                             |LCD Soundsystem                          | 484|\n|JD McPherson - North Side Gal                                                    |JD McPherson                             | 476|\n|Alabama Shakes - Hold On                                                         |Alabama Shakes                           | 471|\n|BOY - Little Numbers                                                             |BOY                                      | 471|\n|The Decemberists - Down By The Water                                             |The Decemberists                         | 471|\n|M83 - Midnight City                                                              |M83                                      | 469|\n|Metric - Youth Without Youth                                                     |Metric                                   | 463|\n|Dessa - Dixon's Girl                                                             |Dessa                                    | 462|\n|Matt And Kim - Cameras                                                           |Matt And Kim                             | 458|\n|Trampled By Turtles - Alone                                                      |Trampled By Turtles                      | 458|\n|The XX - Basic Space                                                             |The XX                                   | 456|\n|Trampled By Turtles - Wait So Long                                               |Trampled By Turtles                      | 455|\n|Band Of Horses - Laredo                                                          |Band Of Horses                           | 454|\n|Frank Ocean - Lost                                                               |Frank Ocean                              | 454|\n|Joy Division - Transmission                                                      |Joy Division                             | 453|\n|Django Django - Default                                                          |Django Django                            | 451|\n|Brother Ali - Fresh Air                                                          |Brother Ali                              | 450|\n|Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues                                                 |Fleet Foxes                              | 450|\n|Phantogram - Mouthful Of Diamonds                                                |Phantogram                               | 450|\n|Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros - 40 Day Dream                              |Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros     | 448|\n|Benjamin Booker - Violent Shiver                                                 |Benjamin Booker                          | 443|\n|Broken Bells - The High Road                                                     |Broken Bells                             | 443|\n|J.

Now came the manual part-- even though these songs are in the right tempo, we need to decide if we like them and if the lyrics would be okay for a first dance. Looking through the list of the top songs from 2009-2018, we didn't see anything we were that excited about. I think part of the problem was the big year range kind of diluted songs that were briefly popular but not over that entire time period.

from 80 songs down to our short list, but it was a process of looking at the artist and song title, looking up lyrics online, and listening to snippets of the song on Tidal (that's right, I used the Spotify API but I'm not a Spotify person!). We eventually got it down to the following,\n\n- Wake Up (Chastity Brown)\n- Love is the Law (The Suburbs)\n- New Song (Warpaint)\n- Colors (Black Pumas)\n- Good for You (Dessa)\n- 99 (Barns Courtney)\n- Let the Good Times Roll (JD McPherson)\n\nI think we ran this whole list by Cindy, and she helped us narrow it down further. We really liked Love is the Law, but it was just a touch too fast for us to dance to comfortably. So we ended up with... [Let the Good Times Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QGE2xjhEY0)! Interestingly, I think they're lindy-hopping in the music video. \n\nLet the Good Times Roll never came up in the lists of swing dance songs, or first dance songs, or swing dance first dance songs that I saw online. While our process of finding a song absolutely had a human in the loop, being able to narrow to songs we would probably like (from our favorite radio station) and then further hone in on songs in the right tempo (using Spotify) allowed us to target our search. \n\nI had a blast dancing with my husband at our wedding, and I think he blew the minds of his friends and family with his dance skills. \n\n\n\n\n",
