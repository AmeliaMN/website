The course will cover the three main methods of communicating information about dataâ€”visually, orally, and in writing. Students will learn to tailor their communication to their audience and create publication-ready and boardroom-ready presentations of their results.\n\nRequired for\n\n-   ~~statistics major~~ data science major\n\n-   data analytics major\n\nI've taught the course six times since spring 2020. \n\n## Course topics\n\nWeek | Topic | Readings | Lab | Deliverables\n----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n1: 9/6 | Introduction to the course | N/A | N/A | Introductions\n2: 9/11-9/15 | Intro to viz | CWD (ch 3), The Functional Art (intro), Visualize This (intro, ch 1)  | Introduction to R, ggplot2 | Data Dialogue, Readiness quiz*\n3:  9/18-9/22 | Color | Design Elements (ch 3), Envisioning Information (ch 5) |  More ggplot2 |  First data viz  \n4:  9/25-9/29 | Handmade viz | CWD (ch 4), Dear Data (selections), Data Points (ch 3) | Hand-drawn data viz | Dear Data idea  \n5:  10/2-10/6 |  Writing about data | CWD (ch 1), How to Lie with Stats (ch 10) | Spreadsheets, summaries and pivot tables | One number story first draft\n6:  10/9-10/13 | Journalistic structure | CWD (ch 2), Numbers in the Newsroom (ch 1-2) |  Interviewing data  | Dear Data final draft \n7:  10/16-10/20 | Perception and principles  | Cleveland (ch 4), Show me the numbers (ch 5), Data Points (ch 5)   | Introduction to Tableau | One number story final draft\n8:  10/23-10/27 | Simplification | CWD (ch 5), Show me the numbers (ch 8), Visual Display (ch. 4, 6) | More ggplot2 | Quiz 1\n9:  10/30-11/3 | Speaking about data  | CWD (ch 11), PowerPoint Does Rocket Science | More Tableau | Copy the masters first draft\n10:  11/6-11/10 | Uncertainty  | TBD, mostly videos | dplyr and tidyr |   Lightning talk first draft\n11:  11/13-11/17 | More variables | Envisioning Information (ch 4), Coordinated Highlighting in Context |  Tableau dashboards | Copy the masters final draft\n12: 11/20-11/24 | Visualizing time   | How to Lie with Maps (ch 2), Envisioning Information (ch 6) |  | Lighting talk final draft\n13: 11/27-12/1 | Visualizing space | TBD | Maps and timelines | \n14: 12/4-12/8 | Weird stuff | |  | Quiz 2 | Final project first draft\n15: 12/11-12/15 | Work time\nDecember 20 | **Project Presentations** | 1:30-3:30 pm\n\n## Grading breakdown\n\n1. Mini-projects [40%]: There will be five mini-projects throughout the semester. The mini projects include Dear Data, Copy the Masters, One Number Story, and the Community Partner Project. Points for mini-projects will vary depending on the complexity of the project.\n\n2. Discussion posts, readiness quizzes, and participation [25%]: Each week, you will need to write a discussion post and complete a readiness quiz. Readiness quizzes will cover material from the reading, and are designed to be easy to complete if you are prepared for class. Discussion posts allow you to expand on your understanding of topics and integrate them with real-world examples. On alternate weeks, you will initialize discussion posts or respond to a classmate's. Beyond these specific items, full course participation includes attendance in class, engagement with in-class discussions, and substantive participation in peer reviews.\n\n3. Quizzes [5%]: Two short, timed, conceptual quizzes on material from readings and baseline technical skills. These quizzes will be more complex than readiness quizzes, and cover more material. \n\n4. Labs [10%]: Throughout the semester, you will be developing new technical skills using R, Tableau, spreadsheet software, and more. There will be periodic lab assignments graded on a complete/incomplete basis. \n\n5. Final Project [20%]: The final project will see you applying what you have learned to a dataset of your choice. There will be several (graded) milestones along the way to help you prepare, and we will hold a demonstration session during the scheduled \"finals\" period for class.\n\n## Mini-projects\n\n- Basic viz\n- Dear data (hand drawn visualization)\n- One number story\n- Lightning talk\n- Community partner project\n- ~~Copy the masters~~\n- ~~Wikipedia article~~\n\n## Iteration and peer review {.smaller}\n\nMany of the mini-projects follow the same general structure:\n\n- an initial idea\n- a first draft\n- peer review\n- second draft \n- (sometimes) a final draft\n\nI think this is one of the more valuable elements of the course, as it helps students see that their first draft often is not perfect. \n\nHowever, it makes it more challenging to assess. How do I assess the content of the initial idea? The first draft? The peer review? Typically, I end up using credit/no credit grading for those pieces, and only giving a more standard grade for the final draft. \n\n## Dear data\n\nBegin with inspiration.\n\nIn my classes, I talk about visualization as art, as well as art as visualization.
